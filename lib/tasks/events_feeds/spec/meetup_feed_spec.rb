Key to its success is the role of the Product Owner, who steers and guides the Scrum project, bridges the gap between end customers, business and development/IT and is responsible for the return on investment (ROI). The Product Owner combines the traditional project and product manager roles in one person.<br /><br />This two-day interactive Scrum Product Owner course equips you with all you need to know to be an effective Product Owner. At the end of the course, you will understand how to leverage Scrum to optimise value creation and customer satisfaction. You will be able to create a realistic release plan, stock the product backlog, write user stories and refine requirements. You will also know how you can increase productivity, level the workload, and steer the project proactively.<br /><br />In addition, please note that this course leads to 16 Professional Development Units (PDUs) as approved by the PMI.<br /><br />This course has been certified by the Scrum Alliance. Successful completion of this course will lead to you obtaining the Certified Scrum Product Owner certification as authorised by the Scrum Alliance. In addition, you will receive 2 years' free membership at the Scrum Alliance.<br /><br />LEARN HOW TO:<br /><br />    * Assume the responsibilities of a Product Owner<br />    * Apply Scrum to optimize customer satisfaction and value creation<br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/agile-scrum/martine-devos-scrum-product-owner/zx-1007" target="_blank">Learn more and book online here.</a><br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/parkbench-panel-discussion-with-pizza-drinks-968/zx-1007" target="_blank"> Watch this FREE video of Martine Devos talking at Agile &amp; Lean OpenSpace session.</a><br /></p>]]></content><id>http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13961069/</id><published>2010-06-30T13:12:48-04:00</published><updated>2010-06-30T13:16:01-04:00</updated><link href="http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13961069/" /></entry><entry><title>London Developers: Takin it to the pub - (Free food + happy hour all night)</title><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Tue Aug 17 18:30:00 BST 2010</h3><img alt="photo" class="photo" src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/e/3/global_11499555.jpeg" style="float:left; margin-right:4px" /><p>This is our monthly social gathering which incorporates members of The London Java Community, Graduate Development Communities, London Scala User Group &amp; OSGi Users’ Forum UK.<br /><br /><b>The evening</b> <br /><br />We meet in the evening on the third Tuesday of every month in a private room at the Lvpo bar in Soho <a href="http://www.lvpo.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.lvpo.co.uk...</a> The event kicks of at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until 11:30 with people coming and going at all times throughout the evening.

This could be Java, .NET or something else. Simon Brown's software architecture development course will make you more 'architecturally aware', and will help you to build better software. It's about pragmatic and real-world software architecture rather than academic "ivory tower" software architecture and is presented by Simon Brown.<br /><br />Software Architecture for Developers is a comprehensive two day training course that will jumpstart your way to becoming a software architect. The course is an interactive introduction to software architecture and what it means to be a software architect. It's aimed at software developers who are looking towards their first software architect role, developers who want to become more architecturally aware and software architects who are new to the role. Throughout the course you'll reinforce everything you learn by defining the architecture for a small software system through a series of hands-on exercises.<br /><br /><b>LEARN HOW TO:</b><br />    * Understand what software architecture is all about.<br />    * Understand what it means to be a software architect and the responsibilities associated with the role.<br />    * Understand the trade-offs that are made when making architectural decisions.<br />    * Experience what it feels like to be an architect on a bespoke software development project; including gathering non-functional requirements, determining the drivers for architecture and defining an architecture.<br />    * Appreciate that even a little architecture can go a long way to building better software.<br />    * Understand that, as a software architect, it's okay to do some coding.<br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/design-architecture/software-architecture-developers/zx-960" target="_blank">Book Online Now!</a><br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/simon-brown-architecture-where-do-you-start/zx-960" target="_blank"> Watch this FREE video of Simon Brown talking about software architecture.</a><br /></p>]]></content><id>http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13738228/</id><published>2010-06-08T14:09:32-04:00</published><updated>2010-06-28T08:42:09-04:00</updated><link href="http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13738228/" /></entry><entry><title>Frank Cohen's Test Automation BootCamp</title><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Mon Sep 13 09:00:00 BST 2010</h3><img alt="photo" class="photo" src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/4/global_1628244.jpeg" style="float:left; margin-right:4px" /><p>In Frank Cohen's 3-day Test Automation Bootcamp, you will learn how to use powerful open source test automation tools to test for scalability, performance and reliability, including Selenium, PushToTest TestMaker and soapUI.

With more than 120 hands-on exercises, this is the most comprehensive class available for soapUI, and will teach you how to use this powerful tool without requiring you to be a test coding expert.<br /><br />You will begin by examining the underlying standards and technologies used by soapUI, such as XML, WSDL, SOAP, XPath, and REST. You will then explore the entire soapUI product, with the goal of quickly becoming familiar with its user interface and test structure. You will discover how to catalog Web and REST-based services, followed by issuing requests to these service providers. Next you will learn how to create and monitor test assertions and set up mock services. You'll understand how to create a wide variety of performance and scalability tests, as well as determine test coverage.

This two day workshop on Test Driven Development (TDD) enables you to experience and learn test driven development by doing it. You will be immersed in a realistic TDD project, allowing you to learn the practices and principles of test driven development and try them out in practice. Through facilitated exercises and discussion, you will experience two days of working on an agile test-driven team. You will use and learn basic Test Driven Development practices including unit testing, refactoring and related agile practices such as continuous integration and pair programming. You will understand the reasons behind TDD and experience its benefits first-hand.<br /><br />By applying what you learn, you will be able to build quality into software from the start, design and develop systems fit for purpose and write code that is easy to maintain and evolve in the future.<br /><br />The is a completely hands-on workshop with coding straight from the start, interrupted by very short presentations to explain the practices and put things into a wider perspective. It is based on the very latest tools, current knowledge and ideas from the community.<br /><br />LEARN HOW TO:<br /><br />    * Design and develop software driven by tests<br />    * Protect software from unwanted changes using regression tests<br />    * Evolve software design with refactoring and TDD<br />    * Recognise smells in the code and clean them up<br />    * Capture requirements and specifications as acceptance tests<br />    * Use executable specifications to drive development<br />    * Continuously integrate software to get quick feedback about changes<br />    * Apply best practices and avoid pitfalls of unit and acceptance testing<br />    * Use MBUnit, Gallio and Moq (.NET/C# developers) or JUnit and Mockito(Java developers) <br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/agile-testing/gojko-adzics-test-driven-development-workshop/zx-1007" target="_blank">Learn More &amp; Book Online Here.</a><br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/using-cucumber-for-bdd-and-agile-acceptance-testing/zx-1007" target="_blank">Watch this FREE video of Gojko Adzic talking about Using Cucumber for BDD and Agile Acceptance Testing.</a><br /></p>]]></content><id>http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13959988/</id><published>2010-06-30T11:31:44-04:00</published><updated>2010-06-30T11:39:20-04:00</updated><link href="http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13959988/" /></entry><entry><title>Eric Evans' Domain Driven Design Hands-On Immersion Workshop</title><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Tue Sep 21 09:00:00 BST 2010</h3><img alt="photo" class="photo" src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/4/global_1628244.jpeg" style="float:left; margin-right:4px" /><p>Eric Evans' 4-day Domain Driven Design Hands-On Immersion Workshop will teach you how to put the domain model to work. Finding and exploiting domain models is key to success with large software systems. By cultivating a strong connection between the language used by developers, appropriate models can dramatically accelerate the process of translating customer needs into working software. Strong domain modeling coupled with programming best practices such as exploiting design patterns, refactoring, and test-driven development result in a principled yet practical approach to the development of large software systems.<br /><br />This intensive course will teach you how to strike a healthy balance between digging into your subject matter and addressing technological issues, which, while unavoidable, cannot be allowed to dominate the development process for commercially viable systems.<br /><br />We weave together lecture, discussion and classroom exercises, including hands-on coding projects. In discussions, you will have the oportunity to discuss your own experiences and relate your own work to the principles and techniques presented in the class. <br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/design-architecture/domain-model/zx-960" target="_blank">Book Online Now</a> (£1935.00 if booked by 22-08-10)<br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/keynote-domain-drive-design/ZX-960" target="_blank"> Watch this FREE video of Eric Evans talking about DDD</a><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>]]></content><id>http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13739835/</id><published>2010-06-08T16:15:22-04:00</published><updated>2010-06-08T16:18:53-04:00</updated><link href="http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13739835/" /></entry><entry><title>London Developers: Takin it to the pub - (Free food + happy hour all night)</title><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Tue Sep 21 18:30:00 BST 2010</h3><img alt="photo" class="photo" src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/e/3/global_11499555.jpeg" style="float:left; margin-right:4px" /><p>This is our monthly social gathering which incorporates members of The London Java Community, Graduate Development Communities, London Scala User Group &amp; OSGi Users’ Forum UK.<br /><br /><b>The evening</b> <br /><br />We meet in the evening on the third Tuesday of every month in a private room at the Lvpo bar in Soho <a href="http://www.lvpo.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.lvpo.co.uk...</a> The event kicks of at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until 11:30 with people coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 60 – 70 members so it is a lively event in which members both junior and senior can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights.

For many Developers who want to focus on their craft, it is sometimes difficult to get a view of Agile development that is neither focused on a project management perspective nor just on the practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD).<br /><br />For the Java or C# developer, an overview of the larger Agile process landscape needs to be complemented with the practical side of software craftsmanship. This ranges from understanding how Scrum can be fine tuned with Lean thinking, to exploring Extreme Programming practices such as TDD and pairing.<br /><br />LEARN HOW TO:<br /><br />    * Describe representative agile development processes and common practices<br />    * Slice up requirements in terms of goals and estimate and plan against them<br />    * Learn modelling techniques and design thinking appropriate for responsive development<br />    * Describe how to carry out Test-Driven Development effectively<br />    * Put concepts into practice<br /><br />This course will be taught by Jon Jagger.<br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/open-source-dot-net/kevlin-henneys-agile-development-for-developers/zx-1007" target="_blank"> Learn More &amp; Book Online Here.</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/kevlin-henney-rethinking-unit-testing-in-c-plus-plus/zx-1007" target="_blank">Watch this FREE video of Kevlin Henney talking about Rethinking Unit Testing in C++.</a><br /></p>]]></content><id>http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13960606/</id><published>2010-06-30T12:27:47-04:00</published><updated>2010-06-30T12:29:49-04:00</updated><link href="http://www.meetup.com/dotnet-121/calendar/13960606/" /></entry></feed>
