      #### with Andy Robinson
      
      Do you develop software in a test driven way? Do you find dealing with other people's tests can sometimes be frustrating? Have you ever thought that there may be a better way of writing tests? This session is for you.
      
      This is a practically focussed presentation and discussion designed to help developers reflect on their testing practice and how they can write better tests, and therefore better software. The session will focus primarily on unit tests, collaboration and mocking, but there will be some discussion of larger integration and acceptance tests. There will be code examples (not all bad), mainly in Java, but anyone familiar with a C-like syntax (like C#) should be able follow. There will be multiple opportunities to suck your teeth and nod sagely.
      
      Andy Robinson has worked in the IT industry in various guises for all of his working life, in research, volunteering, adult education, and for the last ten years as a developer. Andy is currently working as a consultant for Thoughtworks, primarily developing .net and Java web applications.
      
      This event will be held in the Kilburn Building, University of Manchester at 6:45pm on Wednesday 20th October 2010. The venue requires a list of names in advance so, if you'd like to come along, please register.

    - Does your work require you to do lots of things you are really not sure are important, or you know are important only because your manager complains when the are not done? Are you unable to get good practices introduced to your team or buying from management because you don't know how to "sell it" to them? It can be challenging to understand the value in some of your activities, especially when you have a large workload to get through.

      ##### with Robert Rees
      
      NoSql is one of the most important developments in data architecture since the first SQL standard, it can cure cancer and is due to walk on the moon before the end of 2011. NoSql is an overhyped technology that make ludicrous claims, introduces sloppy thinking in systems architecture and kills kittens. Some of these things are true and to try and find out what's buzzword and what's buzzard why don't you come to our NoSql talk? There'll be slides, a Q&A, technology-willing a demo and hopefully some discussion.
      
      _Robert Rees is a consultant at Agile consultancy ThoughtWorks, working with a variety of clients across lots of domains. He works mostly with Java, UNIX and people. He is fascinated by data modelling, emergent technologies and the shock of the new. His main passion is doing everything better all of the time._

    - Jonas Boner is a the creator of Akka project. Witing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable applications is too hard. Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction. Akka is here to change that. Akka is using the Actor Model together with Software Transactional Memory (STM) to raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications.

Groovy raises the bar on what is possible with Semantic Technologies on the JVM. A rich dynamic language that interacts with a rich dynamic data model is all kinds of cool.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] We are very pleased to announce Ellen Gottesdiener's 2-day workshop at Skills Matter on December 9-10th. Join Ellen at this very special workshop and learn how to build skills defining small, valuable, well-defined product requirements for delivery. 
      
      You learn how to build a shared understanding of product needs using collaborative techniques and slice them into well-understood, valuable chunks for developmetn. This training focuses on the "now-view" (iteration or work-in-progress) within the context of the overall product ("big- view") and product releases ("pre-view"). Through practice exercises, you learn to elicit, evaluate, and explore product backlog items, collaborate to analyse product needs, adapt requirements analysis practices and define product needs.
      
      Through exercises, you study how to slice minimum marketable features (MMFs) into righ-sized stories, how to create user story maps, and practical techniques for making stories "ready" for iteration planning and team deliver. You will learn to utilise option analysis and story slicing strategies, with a keen focus on business value. This training emphasises defining and continual pruning of a healthy product backlog, how to collaborate to develop agile requirements, ways to adapt your requirements practices, and the power of "doneness" to clarify requirements.
      
      You gain an appreciation of both the content and the timing of requirements analysis in agile projects, and learn why it's crucial to collaborate with the entire project community througout each delivery cycle.
      
      You leverage EGB's Agile Analysis Roadmap to learn when, where, and how to draw on analysis models. Understand how to calibrate the content, format and timing of requirements analysis to prepare for and participate in planning (iteration, release or kanban) as well as the daily analysis needed to transform requirements into tests and code.
      
      This course is endorsed by the IIBA(r). You earn 14 (b&gt;CDUs (Continuing Development Units) for attending this course.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
      
          * Identify how agile differs from traditional development
          * Define key practices of agile development
          * Analyse, validate, and slice minimum marketable features (MMFs)
          * Identify user stories
          * Model users with roles or personas and process usage witih a user story map
          * Analyse options to slice and "right-size" user stories
          * Validate user stories with doneness criteria
          * Define scenarios and tests for agile requirements
          * Identify and specify nonfunctional requirements for agile requirements
          * Describe the value of supplementing user stories with organic analysis models
          * Understand ways assign business value to requirements
          * Appreciate the business value of just-in-time, just enough agile analysis
          * Calibrate documentation practices for your project
          * Understand how requirements are the basis for agile planning

      ![photo][1] Janet Gregory, the globe-trotting Agile consultant and co-author of the very popular Practical Agile Testing book, will come to London from Calgary Canada in December.
      
      While in London, she'll deliver a free talk on Learning for Agile Testers.
      This is a free event, but please [register][2]  to reserve your seat.
      
      Regardless of what we do, we need to be learning all the time. Many times it is only the application. Sometimes it is new methods and processes. Sometimes it is new ways to analyze, develop or test an application. It may be new languages or new tools. Perhaps most importantly, we learn different ways of dealing with people.
      
      Janet Gregory will share ideas about how to approach this learning curve and the different influences which help us succeed.

      Miles Sabin's 2 day Advanced Scala Development course is aimed at developers who have mastered the essentials of core Scala and want to take their understanding of the language and its compiler to the next level. It covers Scala's powerful type system in depth with concrete illustrations of practical applications of it's more advanced features. The course also introduces the Scala compiler's plug-in architecture and shows how it can be used to support tools and extends the language.

      Agile software development is great at delivering software but doesn't always pay enough attention to what the customer actually wants, needs and values. Sure there is a Product Owner or Customer role - but how often can you get a real customer?   This presentation looks again at the role of requirements in Agile development - where they come from, who gathers them, how they are assessed.  To help with this process Allan will introduce a 10 stage checklist from objective to value delivery.

    - Kevlin Henney's Agile Development for Developers, taught by Jon Jagger
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] We are very happy to have Jon Jagger back at Skills Matter to teach (Kevlin Henney's)  Agile Development for Developers course. Join Jon for this 3-day long, intensive workshop and learn about the Agile principles, practices and processes that offer a path to sustainable development for individuals, teams and organisations. For many Developers who want to focus on their craft, it is sometimes difficult to get a view of Agile development that is neither focused on a project management perspective nor just on the practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
      
      For the Java or C# developer, an overview of the larger Agile process landscape needs to be complemented with the practical side of software craftsmanship. This ranges from understanding how Scrum can be fine tuned with Lean thinking, to exploring Extreme Programming practices such as TDD and pairing.
      
      Learn how to:
      
          * Describe representative agile development processes and common practices
          * Slice up requirements in terms of goals and estimate and plan against them
          * Learn modelling techniques and design thinking appropriate for responsive development
          * Describe how to carry out Test-Driven Development effectively
          * Put concepts into practice
      
      About Jon Jagger
      Jon Jagger is a well-known software coach-consultant-mentor-trainer-programmer specializing in agile software development (people and process), test driven development, deliberate practice, design, analysis, OO, UML, curly bracket languages ( C#, C, C++, Java).

    - Gojko Adzic's Test Driven Development Workshop, taught by Francis Sanger
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] This September, Francis Sanger will run another TDD Workshop (this course was authored by Gojko Adzic). This two day workshop on Test Driven Development (TDD) enables you to experience and learn test driven development by doing it. You will be immersed in a realistic TDD project, allowing you to learn the practices and principles of test driven development and try them out in practice. Through facilitated exercises and discussion, you will experience two days of working on an agile test-driven team. You will use and learn basic Test Driven Development practices including unit testing, refactoring and related agile practices such as continuous integration and pair programming. You will understand the reasons behind TDD and experience its benefits first-hand.
      
      By applying what you learn, you will be able to build quality into software from the start, design and develop systems fit for purpose and write code that is easy to maintain and evolve in the future.
      
      The is a completely hands-on workshop with coding straight from the start, interrupted by very short presentations to explain the practices and put things into a wider perspective. It is based on the very latest tools, current knowledge and ideas from the community.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
      
          * Design and develop software driven by tests
          * Protect software from unwanted changes using regression tests
          * Evolve software design with refactoring and TDD
          * Recognise smells in the code and clean them up
          * Capture requirements and specifications as acceptance tests
          * Use executable specifications to drive development
          * Continuously integrate software to get quick feedback about changes
          * Apply best practices and avoid pitfalls of unit and acceptance testing
          * Use MBUnit, Gallio and Moq (.NET/C# developers) or JUnit and Mockito(Java developers)

      ![photo][1] Agile expert, author and international speaker Martine Devos' will come over to London to run this two day ScrumMaster and Estimation class. Join Martine to learn the fundamental principles of Scrum and gain the skills required to become a Certified ScrumMaster.
      
      Leading a Scrum team is radically different to traditional project management. Rather than plan, instruct, and direct, the leader of a Scrum team (called a ScrumMaster) facilitates, coaches and leads.
      
      In this intensive and highly interactive workshop, you will learn how, whilst dealing with the obstacles that confront Scrum teams. You will also put theory into practise through a variety of exercises and take-aways to use with co-workers.
      
      Upon successful completion of the course, you will be enrolled as a Certified ScrumMaster. This includes a two-year Scrum Alliance membership, where additional ScrumMaster-only material and information is available.
      
      More importantly, upon completion of this workshop you'll leave with an understanding of Scrum and how to put it into practise and succeed with it. You will be able to share your experience with your colleagues and help your teams xecute Scrum efficiently and productively. Delegates will also receive a copy of Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum during the course.
      
      PMI members can claim up to 14 PDU's upon completion of this course

    - Simon Brown's Software Architecture for Developers Workshop
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] Meet Simon Brown, hands-on software architect and consultant, founder of the website [Coding the Architecture][2] , as he travels from Jersey in December to London to teach his 2-day Software Architecture for Developers course.
      
      This course will broaden your software development skills and has been designed to take full advantage of the technical knowledge that you already have. This could be Java, .NET or something else. Simon Brown's software architecture development course will make you more 'architecturally aware', and will help you to build better software. It's about pragmatic and real-world software architecture rather than academic "ivory tower" software architecture and is presented by Simon Brown.
      
      This comprehensive 2 day training course will jumpstart your way to becoming a software architect. It is an interactive introduction to software architecture and what it means to be a software architect. It's aimed at software developers who are looking towards their first software architect role, developers who want to become more architecturally aware and software architects who are new to the role. Throughout the course you'll reinforce everything you learn by defining the architecture for a small software system through a series of hands-on exercises.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
          * Understand what software architecture is all about.
          * Understand what it means to be a software architect and the responsibilities associated with the role.
          * Understand the trade-offs that are made when making architectural decisions.
          * Experience what it feels like to be an architect on a bespoke software development project; including gathering non-functional requirements, determining the drivers for architecture and defining an architecture.
          * Appreciate that even a little architecture can go a long way to building better software.
          * Understand that, as a software architect, it's okay to do some coding.

    - "Free Event: by Software Craftsmanship UK on Designer Code"
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "![photo][1] As programmers it\xC2\x92s easy for us to ignore the more aesthetic elements of the work we do and focus purely on the code. We can often fall into the trap of letting others worry about how well our user interfaces work for the end users, rather than putting the time into thinking about how to design the user experience.\n\n\
      This session will focus on the fact that coding cleanly is actually an exercise in good User Experience, and that the skills we acquire whilst getting better at coding well are directly applicable to thinking about our end users use our systems.\n\
      As part of the session we will take a piece of obfuscated code with a very bad user experience. Guided by tests, we will refactor the code so that it\xC2\x92s as good an experience as possible for others to use.\n\
      Depending on numbers we will either run the practical elements of the session in a Randori style (everyone takes turns to code with their actions being projected) or as a competition: \xC2\x93who can produce the cleanest most readable code in the time available?\xC2\x94 We will then look at lessons learnt from the exercise and how we can apply them to our end customers.\n\
      Session requirements (technical): You will need a basic working knowledge of ruby to participate in the refactoring exercise. If you have it available, please bring a laptop with ruby and rspec installed to run the code.\n\n\
      Attendance is free for registered participants. Please register here (in addition to your meetup rsvp): \n\

    - How The Guardian OpenPlatform (mostly) moved from Java to Scala
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] IMPORTANT Sign up at skillsmatter: 
      [http://skillsmatter.c...][2] 
      
      guardian.co.uk is largely a Java development shop. We implemented our new Content API ([http://content.guardi...][3] ) as our first project in Scala, starting at the beginning of 2010. I'll talk about how we managed the transition and how we learnt scala as a team, with lots of practical examples and code samples.
      
      
      The Guardian's Open Platform initiative enables partners to build applications with The Guardian. As part of this initiative, The Guardian provides the Content API - a rich interface to all The Guardian's content and metadata back to 1991 - over 1 million documents. This talk starts with a brief overview of the latest iteration of the content API. It will then cover how we implemented this in Scala using Solr, addressing real-world problems in creating an index of content:
      how we represented a complex relational database model in Solr
      how we keep the index up to date, meeting a sub-5 minute end-to-end update requirement
      how we update the schema as the API evolves, with zero downtime
      how we scale in response to unpredictable demand, using cloud services

    - LSUG Scala Coding Dojo
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] A regular Scala coding dojo is run every third Thursday of the month.
      
      A coding dojo is great way to learn about the Scala language and will help you gain a greater appreciation of the language and give you practical experience solving a problem with Scala code.
      
      No experience of Scala is required as long as you are enthusiastic to learn and you will get the most benefit from the dojo by getting involved.
      
      A laptop is set up  with a [Scala development environment][2]  and each person will have the opportunity to do 10 minutes of work on the tests and code, paired with a co-pilot.  After 10 minutes the co-pilot will take over the keyboard and a new person will volunteer to be co-pilot. 
      
      The audience will be supplying lots of positive and constructive comments and suggestions and it is therefore beneficial that you share your thoughts with the audience as you work.
      
      Project information and code is being hosted on the Assembla.com site (a bit like project kenai, github, etc).  You can view [more information about lsug-dojo and the projects being tackled][3]  and also [get a copy of the dojo code from the assembla git repository][4] .
      
      If you have any comments, please add them on the meetup.com site.  If you want to discuss things in more detail you can start a thread in the messages tab of the lsug-dojo site.

      ![photo][1] John Smart will give a community talk on Java Testing with JUnit. JUnit is the de facto standard in Java testing. Yet many advanced JUnit features are little known and poorly understood. This session reviews some lesser-known features of JUnit, along with a few associated libraries, that can make your unit tests more powerful, expressive, and fun. The session is intended for Java developers, lead developers, and architects trying to introduce good testing practices into their teams.

    - "Free Event: Talk by Tareq Abedrabbo & Russ Miles: Thinking Specific with DSLs"
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are springing up all over the place, and it's hard to engage with any software development framework without encountering some facets that could be considered under the DSL banner. This is no accident. Given the right mix of technology, convention, domain selection and, most importantly, audience consideration, a DSL can turn the most complicated and esoteric development headache into an expression that is simple (enough) to write, as straightforward to read as a cartoon and slips into the brain's memory and comprehension nodes like 100% proof vodka.
      
      However evaluating and building your own DSLs is no mean feat. So, if you're in the business of writing clean code (go on, hands up, who isn't?!), creating world-class API's, or just love the ego trip of creating your own funky language then there'll be something in this talk for you.
      
      In this talk, Russ Miles and Tareq Abedrabbo (co-creators of the new &quot;Deep Dive DSLs with Groovy&quot; course) will show how they apply DSL principles and practices effectively in order to build and evaluate real world DSLs to write the cleanest, expressive and most productive code possible for a given domain problem.

      Leading a Scrum team is radically different to traditional project management. Rather than plan, instruct, and direct, the leader of a Scrum team (called a ScrumMaster) facilitates, coaches and leads.
      
      In this intensive and highly interactive workshop, you will learn how, whilst dealing with the obstacles that confront Scrum teams. You will also put theory into practise through a variety of exercises and take-aways to use with co-workers.
      
      Upon successful completion of the course, you will be enrolled as a Certified ScrumMaster. This includes a two-year Scrum Alliance membership, where additional ScrumMaster-only material and information is available.
      
      More importantly, upon completion of this workshop you'll leave with an understanding of Scrum and how to put it into practise and succeed with it. You will be able to share your experience with your colleagues and help your teams xecute Scrum efficiently and productively. Delegates will also receive a copy of Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum during the course.
      
      PMI members can claim up to 14 PDU's upon completion of this course

    - Gojko Adzic's Test Driven Development Workshop, taught by Gojko Adzic &  Damjan
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] Next week, Gojko Adzic and Damjan Vujnovic will join up at Skills Matter to run a TDD Workshop. This two day workshop on Test Driven Development (TDD) enables you to experience and learn test driven development by doing it. You will be immersed in a realistic TDD project, allowing you to learn the practices and principles of test driven development and try them out in practice. Through facilitated exercises and discussion, you will experience two days of working on an agile test-driven team. You will use and learn basic Test Driven Development practices including unit testing, refactoring and related agile practices such as continuous integration and pair programming. You will understand the reasons behind TDD and experience its benefits first-hand.
      
      By applying what you learn, you will be able to build quality into software from the start, design and develop systems fit for purpose and write code that is easy to maintain and evolve in the future.
      
      The is a completely hands-on workshop with coding straight from the start, interrupted by very short presentations to explain the practices and put things into a wider perspective. It is based on the very latest tools, current knowledge and ideas from the community.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
      
          * Design and develop software driven by tests
          * Protect software from unwanted changes using regression tests
          * Evolve software design with refactoring and TDD
          * Recognise smells in the code and clean them up
          * Capture requirements and specifications as acceptance tests
          * Use executable specifications to drive development
          * Continuously integrate software to get quick feedback about changes
          * Apply best practices and avoid pitfalls of unit and acceptance testing
          * Use MBUnit, Gallio and Moq (.NET/C# developers) or JUnit and Mockito(Java developers)

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "![photo][1] Jean-Paul Sylvain Boodhoo's five day (intense) Nothin\xC2\x92 but .NET Developer Boot Camp course will focus on applying .NET development best practices in the context of developing a working N-Tiered application. You will learn about how to practically apply .NET as you utitlise it to the task of building a complete application from the UI layer all the way down to the mapping layer.\n\n\
      You will learn techniques and tools that will dramatically increase your day to day productivity as a software developer. This course will focus on a code centric view of application development versus the typical databinding/designer magic covered by many typical .NET courses. You will walk away with a deep understanding of fundamental aspects of .NET and how these pieces can be used to develop and deliver enterprise scale applications. \n\n\
      IS THIS COURSE FOR YOU?\n\
      If you are expecting to come to this course to learn about how to have Visual Studio .NET automatically generate an \"application\" for you, then this course is NOT for you. The Nothin\xC2\x92 but .NET Developer Boot Camp is all about taking control of the .NET framework and having it work the way you want. This course will place a heavy emphasis on getting back to the basics and making .NET do things the way you want it to, in a predictable and testable way.\n\n\

    - Brian Sletten's Semantic Web Technologies Bootcamp
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] We are very pleased to announce that internationally semantic web expert Brian Sletten will visit us here in London in February of 2011 to give this exclusive Semantic Web Technologies bootcamp!
      
      Brian Sletten's 5 day Semantic Web Technologies Bootcamp provides a broad, example-driven and compelling vision of computing's future. Organisations are struggling with data integration solutions that operate at the wrong level of abstraction or are shackled to legacy systems with no idea of how to modernize incrementally. Their service-oriented architectures decompose business processes into services without the ability to identify and protect the information that flows through these services. In this course, you will learn how the technical and business value of Web semantics is available and useful today behind firewalls as well as on the public Web.
      
      This course will also help you understand how tensions between the business and technical sides of the house can be mediated by adopting Semantic Web technologies that provide information-focused, business-friendly solutions that grow with the organisation and its changing business needs.
      
      Through plenty of intensive practical exercises, you will learn how to apply Semantic Web technologies to solve existing data management, integration and knowledge-sharing problems. Examples will show how Semantic Web technologies integrate with existing technologies to achieve business value with agile architectures and succesful migration strategies. Through practical exercises you will also gain the skills required to integrate legacy and next-generation systems, whilst protecting information by controlling its access from different contexts.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
      
          * Explain the Web and Web architecture at a deeper level
          * Apply Web and Semantic Web technologies in the Enterprise and make them work together
          * Create good, long-lived logical names (URIs) for information and services
          * Build and consume RESTful services from Java and other languages
          * Implement the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
          * Use popular RDF vocabularies such as Dublin Core, FOAF, DOAP
          * Query RDF and non-RDF datastores with the SPARQL query language
          * Use the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) and how to represent taxonomies in RDF
          * Model with the Web Ontology Language (OWL)
          * Choose and implement major open source and commercial tools that support Semantic Web technologies, including Mulgara, Sesame, TopBraid Composer and Protege

    - Simon Brown's Software Architecture for Developers Workshop
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Meet Simon Brown, hands-on software architect and consultant, founder of the website [Coding the Architecture][1] , as he travels from Jersey in February 2011 to London to teach his 2-day Software Architecture for Developers course.
      
      This course will broaden your software development skills and has been designed to take full advantage of the technical knowledge that you already have. This could be Java, .NET or something else. Simon Brown's software architecture development course will make you more 'architecturally aware', and will help you to build better software. It's about pragmatic and real-world software architecture rather than academic &quot;ivory tower&quot; software architecture and is presented by Simon Brown.
      
      This comprehensive 2 day training course will jumpstart your way to becoming a software architect. It is an interactive introduction to software architecture and what it means to be a software architect. It's aimed at software developers who are looking towards their first software architect role, developers who want to become more architecturally aware and software architects who are new to the role. Throughout the course you'll reinforce everything you learn by defining the architecture for a small software system through a series of hands-on exercises.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
          * Understand what software architecture is all about.
          * Understand what it means to be a software architect and the responsibilities associated with the role.
          * Understand the trade-offs that are made when making architectural decisions.
          * Experience what it feels like to be an architect on a bespoke software development project; including gathering non-functional requirements, determining the drivers for architecture and defining an architecture.
          * Appreciate that even a little architecture can go a long way to building better software.
          * Understand that, as a software architect, it's okay to do some coding.

    - Martine Devos' 2 day course Certified Scrum Product Owner teaches you how to become an effective Product Owner. Scrum is a simple but powerful agile management framework. Key to its success is the role of the Product Owner, who steers and guides the Scrum project, bridges the gap between end customers, business and development/IT and is responsible for the return on investment (ROI). The Product Owner combines the traditional project and product manager roles in one person.

      For a developer, deliberate practice means trying new things, trying old things with a view to making them fresh and trying to move from accidental practice to intentional discipline.
      
      In this course, Kevlin Henney and Jon Jagger will help you evaluate and improve your test cases using Test-Driven Development; learn pairing and team skills by putting them into practice; identify blindspots in our own thinking, such as evaluating the quality of your own work; and learn how to learn and unlearn through deliberate practice.

      ![photo][1] How do you develop expertise? Peter Norvig writes: "The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again." 
      
      For a developer, deliberate practice means trying new things, trying old things with a view to making them fresh and trying to move from accidental practice to intentional discipline. Deliberate practice improves technical agility through increased self awareness.

      Jonas Boner is a the creator of Akka project.
      
      Jonas Boner's two day Pragmatic Real-World Scala course will teach you all you need to know about Scala, one of the most interesting new languages for the JVM. A unique and elegant blend of the Object-Oriented (OO) and Functional Programming (FP) paradigms, Scala is pragmatic and practical with seamless interoperability with Java.
      
      Scala stands for 'Scalable Language' and is designed to scale with the needs and requirements of its users. It is statically typed but with good type inference and style which gives it a dynamic feel similar to Ruby or Python, but with the performance and safety only a statically typed language can provide. This makes it great for a wide range of use-cases, from internal DSLs to large-scale enterprise applications or container code.

      ![photo][1] Agile software development is great at delivering software but doesn't always pay enough attention to what the customer actually wants, needs and values. Sure there is a Product Owner or Customer role - but how often can you get a real customer? This presentation looks again at the role of requirements in Agile development - where they come from, who gathers them, how they are assessed. To help with this process Allan will introduce a 10 stage checklist from objective to value delivery. 
      
      Attendance is free for registered attendees. Please [find out more, and register][2]  on the Skills Matter website (in addition to your Meetup RSVP) to let us know you are coming?!

      If you believe what you read everywhere, all software teams are writing their applications using the latest technology with a comprehensive set of automated tests on their highly productive agile projects.
      
      Unfortunately the reality for some of us is far from this, with our projects suffering from a range of problems. In this session, we'll be looking at one or more software projects that are having issues and explore how to resolve them in an effective yet pragmatic way. If you want to see your own (anonymised) project featured in this session, you can contact Simon prior to this session ([simon's contact details on SM website][1] ). 
      
      This is your opportunity to get some free consultancy or to get a glimpse of how other software teams approach their projects. 
      
      If you would like to join this session, please[ find out more or register on the Skills Matter website][2]  (in addition to your Meetup RSVP), so we know you're coming?!
      
      Looking forward to seeing you there?!

      This talk will cover the basics of using [Geb][1]  to automate browser testing.
      It will compare Geb with raw WebDriver/Selenium showing Geb's expressive Groovy API.
      It will also demonstrate how to integrate Geb with acceptance testing frameworks, namely Cucumber via Cuke4Duke.
      
      We will also cover an experience report on how and why we transitioned from raw WebDriver to Geb and how existing WebDriver projects can be ported across to Geb with minimal initial effort due to its underlying use of WebDriver.

      Jonas Boner is a the creator of the open source [Akka project][1] .
      
      Witing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable applications is too hard. Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction. 
      
      Akka is here to change that. Akka is using the Actor Model together with Software Transactional Memory (STM) to raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. For fault-tolerance it adopts the &quot;Let it crash&quot; model which have been used with great success in the Telecom industry to build applications that self-heals, systems that never stop. Akka's Remote Actors, together with the Clustering module, provides the abstraction for transparent distribution, adaptive automatic load-balancing and cluster rebalancing, replication and is the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications. 
      
      In this course you will learn what Akka is, the ideas behind its design and implementation and how it can be used to solve hard real-world problems. It is a practical hand-on course with roughly and equal split between theory sessions and labs.

    - Jan Machacek's Practical Spring Web Workshop
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] Renowned Chief Architect at [Cake ][2] , Jan Machacek, is a regular presenter at conferences, co-author of four books, including [Pro Spring 3][3] , and a friendly, approachable, [Skills Matter][4]  regular to boot; one who we are happy to welcome back to the eXchange for a three-day Practical Spring Web Workshop.
      
      Jan will be covering the efficient use of Spring to develop rock-solid and efficient web applications, highlighting modern programming approaches: minimising dependencies, favouring declarative over imperative approaches.
      
      Over the course of three days, Jan will take you all the way from the basics to exploring much more advanced concepts in Spring MVC: how the Spring Framework routes the http requests to your controllers; how it maps request parameters to method parameters; how to extend the Spring MVC infrastructure.
      
      Jan's approach is very hands-on and interactive, with lab sessions following all of the theoretical material covered.
      
      If you want to know how to efficiently build web applications on top of the proven Spring technology stack, in a practical way, with real know-how gained, not simply talked about, Jan's Workshop is the course for you!

    - Gojko Adzic's Test Driven Development Workshop, feat Damjan Vujnovic Feb 14-15
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Damjan Vujnovic will join us at Skills Matter to run (Gojko Adzic's) TDD Workshop. This two day workshop on Test Driven Development (TDD) enables you to experience and learn test driven development by doing it. You will be immersed in a realistic TDD project, allowing you to learn the practices and principles of test driven development and try them out in practice. Through facilitated exercises and discussion, you will experience two days of working on an agile test-driven team. You will use and learn basic Test Driven Development practices including unit testing, refactoring and related agile practices such as continuous integration and pair programming. You will understand the reasons behind TDD and experience its benefits first-hand.
      
      By applying what you learn, you will be able to build quality into software from the start, design and develop systems fit for purpose and write code that is easy to maintain and evolve in the future.
      
      The is a completely hands-on workshop with coding straight from the start, interrupted by very short presentations to explain the practices and put things into a wider perspective. It is based on the very latest tools, current knowledge and ideas from the community.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
      
          * Design and develop software driven by tests
          * Protect software from unwanted changes using regression tests
          * Evolve software design with refactoring and TDD
          * Recognise smells in the code and clean them up
          * Capture requirements and specifications as acceptance tests
          * Use executable specifications to drive development
          * Continuously integrate software to get quick feedback about changes
          * Apply best practices and avoid pitfalls of unit and acceptance testing
          * Use MBUnit, Gallio and Moq (.NET/C# developers) or JUnit and Mockito(Java developers)

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Experienced chief architect and Skills Matter regular on all number of Spring courses, Jan is back in the eXchange for a two-day workshop on Spring Roo, and all its intricacies.
      
      Jan will be covering the task Roo sets out to solve, the technical details of the solutions and, perhaps most importantly, the architectural choices Roo makes for you. 
      
      In particular, he will be looking at how to use Roo, how to run the code it produces, and how to modify the code manually as well as using further Roo commands. 
      
      He will be exploring the types of applications Roo allows you to create, including the architectural implications of the Roo applications. At the end of the course, you will be able to: understand when and how to use Roo; create applications in Roo; take the Roo code and extend it either manually or using further Roo commands. You will also gain a good understanding of the core architectural concepts in Roo that you can use in your Roo or Spring applications.
      
      If you are looking for a great introduction to Roo, and how to create robust applications with it, look no further.

    - "Udi Dahan will be back with us in February, to give his incredibly popular and inspiring workshop on Advanced Distributed Systems Design, communication patterns and his ideas on designing large-scale distributed systems, DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, messaging and NServiceBus. \n\n\
      Only attend this workshop if you are prepared to challenge your beliefs and be open to new ways of thinking (really!)\n\n\
      The Advanced Distributed Systems Design with SOA will help you take the pain out of designing large-scale distributed systems. New technologies make it easier to comply with today\xC2\x92s communications and security standards, but they won't magically provide you with a robust and scalable system.  This course is packed with the wisdom of companies like SUN, Amazon and EBay.\n\n\
      Tried-and-true theories and fallacies will be shown, helping you to avoid costly mistakes. Communications patterns like publish/subscribe and correlated one-way request/response will be demonstrated, in conjunction with advanced object-oriented state management practices for long-running workflows. If you enjoy deep architectural discussion, if you are in charge of building a large-scale distributed system, and if you want to know more about how the big guys run their systems, sign up for this workshop!\n\n\
      Modules:\n\
      1:  Distributed Systems Theory\n\
      2:  Coupling: Platform, Temporal, &amp; Spatial\n\
      3:  Asynchronous Messaging Patterns\n\
      4:  Bus &amp; Broker Architectural Styles\n\
      5:  SOA Building Blocks\n\
      6:  Scalability and Flexibility\n\
      7:  Long running processes\n\
      8:  Service / Autonomous Component Solution Structure\n\
      9:  Service Layer \xC2\x96 Domain Model Interaction\n\
      10: Creating High-Performance Domain Models\n\
      11: Web Services and User Interfaces\n\
      12: Case Study\n\n\

    - LSUG Scala Coding Dojo
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] A regular Scala coding dojo is run every third Thursday of the month.
      
      A coding dojo is great way to learn about the Scala language and will help you gain a greater appreciation of the language and give you practical experience solving a problem with Scala code.
      
      No experience of Scala is required as long as you are enthusiastic to learn and you will get the most benefit from the dojo by getting involved.
      
      A laptop is set up  with a [Scala development environment][2]  and each person will have the opportunity to do 10 minutes of work on the tests and code, paired with a co-pilot.  After 10 minutes the co-pilot will take over the keyboard and a new person will volunteer to be co-pilot. 
      
      The audience will be supplying lots of positive and constructive comments and suggestions and it is therefore beneficial that you share your thoughts with the audience as you work.
      
      Project information and code is being hosted on the Assembla.com site (a bit like project kenai, github, etc).  You can view [more information about lsug-dojo and the projects being tackled][3]  and also [get a copy of the dojo code from the assembla git repository][4] .
      
      If you have any comments, please add them on the meetup.com site.  If you want to discuss things in more detail you can start a thread in the messages tab of the lsug-dojo site.

      ![photo][1] Hello, I'm your new organizer for the "London C/C++ Meetup Group".
      I am focusing on "Building Portfolio" and "Managing Projects". Would be nice if we could come up with a webpage with freecode of ours. We are asked to bring an A4 page written with a specification for a C++ win 32 app. Someone will try to do it. We can change them with someone that wants to change them after them being hashed for distribuition among everyone present.
      We shall meet at 7pm. at "Montagu Pyke":105-107 Charing Cross Road. Please come with your hat or as geeky as possible!!! The "meetup hat" rules! Please get one at Zazzle.co.uk
      The new image is not fitting. I will adjust that for it to look less crappy.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "![photo][1] This is our monthly social gathering, which incorporates members of The London Java Community and Graduate Development Communities. This is an informal social evening most of the evening will be spent having ad-hoc informal discussions in small groups, we have added a theme to the evening to make it more interesting for all involved and make it less intimidating for new members. \n\n\
      This month the theme will be around what 2011 holds for the LJC.\n\n\
      A new year and a new venue. This month will be our first event at a new venue [the Porterhouse][2] : [http://www.porterhous...][3]  We have booked out the top floor, the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world. This month they will be throwing on a few plates of food for us too. \n\n\
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 \xC2\x96 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights.\n\n\
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/e/3/global_11499555.jpeg\n  [2]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n  [3]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n"

      Sean O'Halpin will be telling us about some work at the BBC involving twitter: " I'll be talking about how we're using Ruby to process tweets in realtime to discover inbound links to the BBC Zeitgeist and how we're reading the Twitter Firehose (about 1000 tweets/sec = about 90 million a day) and storing the data in Amazon S3. There'll be a bit about Hadoop and Map/Reduce too."

      Matthew has been living it up in Hong Kong for the past year and will be making a brief stop at our humble meeting to explain some of the work he's been doing there in building a financial application. He promises to cover at least some of these things:
      
          * big ints and careful rounding
          * locking strategy
          * state machines
          * currency handling

      ![photo][1] To kick off 2011 and to help keep on track with our new years resolutions and goals for the year we are running a personal kanban workshop at the January Limited WIP Society meeting.
      
      Personal kanban has been used to manage our busy lives very effectively by a growing number of people and I too have found it invaluable to get so much more out of 2010.
      
      John Stevenson would like to share the techniques he's been using with personal kanban, such as just-in-time planning, review techniques, managing events, keeping in line with personal goals, etc. The workshop is also an opportunity to show your techniques to manage your priorities.
      The workshop will be a great opportunity to gather lots of ideas on how to make the most out of 2011.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      ![photo][1] If you believe what you read everywhere, all software teams are writing their applications using the latest technology with a comprehensive set of automated tests on their highly productive agile projects.
      Unfortunately the reality for some of us is far from this, with our projects suffering from a range of problems. In this session, we'll be looking at one or more software projects that are having issues and explore how to resolve them in an effective yet pragmatic way. Please get in touch by e-mailing simon.brown@codingthearchitecture.com if you want to see your own (anonymised) project featured in this session. This is your opportunity to get some free consultancy or to get a glimpse of how other software teams approach their projects.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - " \n\
      We're happy to announce this free talk by Linda Rising, an international expert and speaker on topics related to patterns, retrospectives, agile development, and the change process, when she travels from USA to London in February.\n\n\
      [This is a FREE talk, but please register here.][1] \n\n\
      Synopsis:\n\
      Cognitive scientists tell us that we are more productive and happier when our behaviour matches our brain\xC2\x92s hard-wiring; when, what we do and why we do it matches the way we have evolved to survive over tens of thousands of years.\n\n\
      One problematic behaviour humans have is that we are hard-wired to instantly decide who we trust. And we generally aren't aware of these decisions\xC2\x97it just happens.\n\n\
      Linda Rising explains that this hard-wired \xC2\x93trust evaluation\xC2\x94 can get in the way of working well with others.\n\n\
      Pairing, the daily stand-up, and close communication with the customer and others outside the team go a long way to overcome our instant evaluation of others. As Linda helps you gain a better understanding of this mechanism in your behaviour and what agile processes can do to help, you are more likely to build better interpersonal relationships and create successful products.\n\n\
      ** More about Linda Rising **\n\
      With a Ph.D. from Arizona State University in the field of object-based design metrics, Linda Rising\xC2\x92s background includes university teaching and industry work in telecommunications, avionics, and tactical weapons systems.\n\n\
      An internationally known presenter on topics related to patterns, retrospectives, agile development, and the change process, Linda is the author of numerous articles and four books\xC2\x97Design Patterns in Communications, The Pattern Almanac 2000, A Patterns Handbook, and Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas, written with Mary Lynn Manns.

      ![photo][1] Happy New Year! To kick off 2011, we thought we'd start with an evening of hands-on coding, dojo-style. 
      
      Members are invited to submit a coding challenge which we can attempt to solve on the night. Some ideas include:
      
      - writing a game in F# with Silverlight or XNA
      - MapReduce with F# agents 
      - solving a Project Euler problem
      - build a Unit Testing Framework
      
      Depending on numbers and topics, we'll split into small groups to work through and discuss a chosen challenge. Feel free to bring your own laptop.
      
      To send us your ideas, either submit as a comment below or [send us a message][2] .

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      When devops gets mentioned, the discussion tends to fall in two parts: the technology part and the cultural part. When devops get's mentioned the discussion tends to fall in two parts: the technology part and the cultural part.
      
      Sure, a lot is happening at the technology side: virtualization, cloud and more recently infrastructure as code. All cool stuff. And a good toolset sure is worth a lot for getting the job done more easily. Still tools will only have a mild impact on making people collaborate. Collaboration is really the core of the devops idea, plain and simple. 
      But even if the idea is simple, it doesn't mean the implementation is easy: a lot of resistance needs to be overcome. 
      
      Phrases like: &quot;this will never work&quot;, &quot;it's only for those cool web 2.0 companies&quot;, &quot;it only works for small startups&quot; are not usual when a mentality shift is introduced. Within this session, we will highlight several stories from the trenches how people are trying to bootstrap devops within their organizations and the benefits they got from it. Besides what worked, we will also explain the things that didn't work well. 
      
      Remember devops is no silver bullet. It's still hard work to get it going. At the end of the session, we hope to have provided you with several practical and useful tips to make it work inside YOUR company: How to get devs and ops work together, overcome management resistance, start working on the same goals and teams. That is of course if you want it !

      The doors will open at 18:00 for some refreshments sponsored by PlayFish and if we're lucky playing in their Rockband lounge. 
      
      At 18:30 we will have a few lightening talks on Concurrency, including Campbell Wilson of PlayFish speaking on Concurrency and the general architecture of their highly scalable Social Games.
      
      For our main event Ben Evans of Deutsche Bank will present a very distinctive take on Modern Java Concurrency 
      
      Synopsis: Clock speed and performance are no longer increasing as spectacularly as they once did. Instead the focus has turned to more cores per chip. This talk provides a unique perspective on the Java concurrency landscape as it exists today (both "classic" and java.util.concurrent), and some pointers towards the future of concurrency across the platform.

      The basics of Test Driven Development are now well understood and widely popular, but many teams never move beyond them.
      
      In this presentation Gojko Adzic talks about ideas that will help you take the next step and move beyond basic TDD and learning how to use it effectively in many different contexts. Gojko will talk about how to get more out of unit testing and TDD and present pros and cons of various approaches to TDD design.

    - Securing the Web with SSL
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |-
      SSL is the technology that secures the Internet, but it only works how you're expecting when used properly, and when configured properly. Also, SSL has traditionally added overhead to the process and as such may not be used in cases when it really should be - perhaps due to the perceived overhead, or perhaps due to the difficulty in deploying to an environment.  What we're looking to discuss is the fundamentals:
      
      a) what is the problem if we're not using SSL?  We'll be looking to demo some of these (e.g. Firesheep)
      b) if we are using SSL, can we have some on SSL and some not? What would that look like as an implementation?
      c) what are the gotchas with SSL? Or, what are the issues that can lead to SSL not actually securing you?

      If you believe what you read everywhere, all software teams are writing their applications using the latest technology with a comprehensive set of automated tests on their highly productive agile projects.
      Unfortunately the reality for some of us is far from this, with our projects suffering from a range of problems. In this session, we'll be looking at one or more software projects that are having issues and explore how to resolve them in an effective yet pragmatic way. Please get in touch by e-mailing simon.brown@codingthearchitecture.com if you want to see your own (anonymised) project featured in this session. This is your opportunity to get some free consultancy or to get a glimpse of how other software teams approach their projects.

      Project information and code is being hosted on the Assembla.com site (a bit like project kenai, github, etc).  You can view [more information about lsug-dojo and the projects being tackled][1]  and also [get a copy of the dojo code from the assembla git repository][2] .
      
      A laptop will be provided with the [development environment][3]  ready to use.
      
      Each person will have the opportunity to do 10 minutes of work on the tests and code, paired with a co-pilot.  After 10 minutes the co-pilot will take over the keyboard and a new person will volunteer to be co-pilot. 
      
      The audience will be supplying lots of positive and constructive comments and suggestions and it is therefore beneficial that you share your thoughts with the audience as you work.
      
      If you have any comments, please add them on the meetup.com site.  If you want to discuss things in more detail you can start a thread in the messages tab of the lsug-dojo site.

    - Robert Pickering's Beginning F# Workshop - March 16-17th
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "Robert Pickering is joining us from Paris for the Functional Programming eXchange conference, which we will be running this March... Whilst he's here, he'll also run this Beginning F# Workshop, which  is a two day course that will teach you all about F#, an exciting new language that has evolved from a Microsoft Research project into a first class citizen of Visual Studio 2010. You will discover how F# can be used to express programs concisely and efficiently; you\xC2\x92ll also learn how to start having fun with this enormously productive language.\n\n\
      This F# course will start with an introduction to F# and functional programming. It will show you how to use F#\xC2\x92s powerful immutable data structures to reduce the amount of mutable state your programs require. You'll look at how functions can be used to build complex solutions by composing a number of simple and elegant building blocks. You will also learn how F# allows you to easily mix functional programming with both object oriented and imperative style programming.\n\n\
      As the course progresses will you will learn, though a mixture of presentations and hands on labs, how to use F# to do both asynchronous and parallel programming. You'll look at advance parallel programming by message passing between agents. You'll then move on to using DSLs and language oriented techniques to increase programmer productivity. Finally, you\xC2\x92ll look at how a combination of DSLs, meta and parallel programming can be used to run certain kinds of algorithms on the GPU, greatly increasing their performance.\n\n\

This will be a chance to meet with some senior developers to find out what they would advise about getting into the industry. It is an informal social evening with no agenda - most of the evening will be spent having ad-hoc informal discussions in small groups.\n\n\
      This month will be our first event at a new venue[ the Porterhouse][2] : [http://www.porterhous...][3]  We have booked out the top floor, the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world. This month they will be throwing on a few plates of food for us too. \n\n\
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 \xC2\x96 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights.\n\n\
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/c/5/global_11500037.jpeg\n  [2]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n  [3]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n"

      Haml and Sass are two languages that have been growing in popularity since I first introduced them in 2005. They both are ways to construct and conceptualize the HTML and CSS output of your web applications.
      
      Originally a Ruby technology, there are now Haml interpreters in almost every language: PHP, Java, Python, .NET, ASP.NET, Scala, and Javascript.
      
      Come learn about these two exciting languages and have your mind stretched a bit.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "The Skills Matter eXchange plays host, once more, to a London Scala Users' Group LSUG evening event: Cloud Computing with Scala and GridGain.\n\n\
      The topic of the presentation will be the use of the Scala programming language with GridGain framework to provide a simple and productive cloud computing platform.\n\n\
      Scala is a hybrid function and object-oriented language that is rapidly gaining traction in becoming the \xC2\x93next\xC2\x94 Java in JVM-based language evolution. GridGain is one of the most rapidly growing cloud development platforms for JVM-based languages. \n\n\
      Two-third's of the presentation will be devoted to a live coding demonstration of writing a basic MapReduce application in Scala using GridGain middleware. All the coding during the demonstration will be done live. An overview of grid and cloud computing concepts as well as the notion of Native Cloud Applications will be discussed, and a brief intro into to the Scala language will also be provided.\n\n\

This will be a chance to meet with some senior developers to find out what they would advise about getting into the industry. It is an informal social evening with no agenda - most of the evening will be spent having ad-hoc informal discussions in small groups.\n\n\
      We have booked out the top floor of [the Porterhouse ][1] in Covent Garden [http://www.porterhous...][2] , the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world. \n\n\
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 \xC2\x96 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights. \n\n\
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n  [2]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n"

      Robert's 'Beginning F# Workshop' is a two day course that will teach you all about F#, an exciting new language that has evolved from a Microsoft Research project into a first class citizen of Visual Studio 2010. You will discover how F# can be used to express programs concisely and efficiently; you\xC2\x92ll also learn how to start having fun with this enormously productive language. \n\n\
      The course will start with the basics - from its syntax through to its unique elements - and cover the fundamentals of basic application creation, all the way to complex ones that make use of F#'s asynchronous and parallel programming, and GPU usage.\n\n\
      Book early and take advantage of our early-bird discounts!\n\n\

      We have booked out the top floor of the Porterhouse in Covent Garden [[http://www.porterhous...][1] ][2] , the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world. \n\n\
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 \xC2\x96 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights. \n\n\
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n  [2]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n"

    - "FREE TALK: In the Brain of Simon Brown - Software Project SOS"
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      If you believe what you read everywhere, all software teams are writing their applications using the latest technology with a comprehensive set of automated tests on their highly productive agile projects.
      Unfortunately the reality for some of us is far from this, with our projects suffering from a range of problems. In this session, we'll be looking at one or more software projects that are having issues and explore how to resolve them in an effective yet pragmatic way. Please get in touch by e-mailing simon.brown@codingthearchitecture.com if you want to see your own (anonymised) project featured in this session. This is your opportunity to get some free consultancy or to get a glimpse of how other software teams approach their projects.

    - "FREE TALK: In The Brain of Patrick Debois - Bootstrapping a devops mentality"
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      When devops gets mentioned, the discussion tends to fall in two parts: the technology part and the cultural part. When devops get's mentioned the discussion tends to fall in two parts: the technology part and the cultural part.
      
      Sure, a lot is happening at the technology side: virtualization, cloud and more recently infrastructure as code. All cool stuff. And a good toolset sure is worth a lot for getting the job done more easily. Still tools will only have a mild impact on making people collaborate. Collaboration is really the core of the devops idea, plain and simple. 
      But even if the idea is simple, it doesn't mean the implementation is easy: a lot of resistance needs to be overcome. 
      
      Phrases like: &quot;this will never work&quot;, &quot;it's only for those cool web 2.0 companies&quot;, &quot;it only works for small startups&quot; are not usual when a mentality shift is introduced. Within this session, we will highlight several stories from the trenches how people are trying to bootstrap devops within their organizations and the benefits they got from it. Besides what worked, we will also explain the things that didn't work well. 
      
      Remember devops is no silver bullet. It's still hard work to get it going. At the end of the session, we hope to have provided you with several practical and useful tips to make it work inside YOUR company: How to get devs and ops work together, overcome management resistance, start working on the same goals and teams. That is of course if you want it !

      For our main event Ben Evans of Deutsche Bank will present a very distinctive take on Modern Java Concurrency 
      
      Synopsis: Clock speed and performance are no longer increasing as spectacularly as they once did. Instead the focus has turned to more cores per chip. This talk provides a unique perspective on the Java concurrency landscape as it exists today (both "classic" and java.util.concurrent), and some pointers towards the future of concurrency across the platform.

    - Martine Devos' Certified Scrum Product Owner
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Martine Devos is a persuasive and highly passionate communicator, public speaker and published author focused on Agile methods. Leveraging years of research and experience, Martine trains and coaches teams in Agile principles and practices, including Agile Project Management, Scrum, Kanban and Lean Software Engineering.
      
      Martine's two day course Certified Scrum Product Owner teaches you how to become an effective Product Owner.
      
      Scrum is a simple but powerful agile management framework. Key to its success is the role of the Product Owner, who steers and guides the Scrum project, bridges the gap between end customers, business and development/IT and is responsible for the return on investment (ROI). The Product Owner combines the traditional project and product manager roles in one person.
      
      This two-day interactive Scrum Product Owner course equips you with all you need to know to be an effective Product Owner. At the end of the course, you will understand how to leverage Scrum to optimise value creation and customer satisfaction. You will be able to create a realistic release plan, stock the product backlog, write user stories and refine requirements. You will also know how you can increase productivity, level the workload, and steer the project proactively.
      
      For more information please folow link: [http://skillsmatter.c...][1] 
      
      If you are a Product, Project or Innovation Manager, Business Analyst or ScrumMaster and you would like to deepen your understanding of the Product Owner role and related practices, this is the course for you!

    - Simon Brown's Software Architecture for Developers Workshop
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Meet Simon Brown, hands-on software architect and consultant, founder of the website [Coding the Architecture][1] , as he travels from Jersey in February 2011 to London to teach his 2-day Software Architecture for Developers course.
      
      This course will broaden your software development skills and has been designed to take full advantage of the technical knowledge that you already have. This could be Java, .NET or something else. Simon Brown's software architecture development course will make you more 'architecturally aware', and will help you to build better software. It's about pragmatic and real-world software architecture rather than academic &quot;ivory tower&quot; software architecture and is presented by Simon Brown.
      
      This comprehensive 2 day training course will jumpstart your way to becoming a software architect. It is an interactive introduction to software architecture and what it means to be a software architect. It's aimed at software developers who are looking towards their first software architect role, developers who want to become more architecturally aware and software architects who are new to the role. Throughout the course you'll reinforce everything you learn by defining the architecture for a small software system through a series of hands-on exercises.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
          * Understand what software architecture is all about.
          * Understand what it means to be a software architect and the responsibilities associated with the role.
          * Understand the trade-offs that are made when making architectural decisions.
          * Experience what it feels like to be an architect on a bespoke software development project; including gathering non-functional requirements, determining the drivers for architecture and defining an architecture.
          * Appreciate that even a little architecture can go a long way to building better software.
          * Understand that, as a software architect, it's okay to do some coding.

      For a developer, deliberate practice means trying new things, trying old things with a view to making them fresh and trying to move from accidental practice to intentional discipline.
      
      In this course, Kevlin Henney and Jon Jagger will help you evaluate and improve your test cases using Test-Driven Development; learn pairing and team skills by putting them into practice; identify blindspots in our own thinking, such as evaluating the quality of your own work; and learn how to learn and unlearn through deliberate practice.

      Jonas Boner is a the creator of Akka project.
      
      Jonas Boner's two day Pragmatic Real-World Scala course will teach you all you need to know about Scala, one of the most interesting new languages for the JVM. A unique and elegant blend of the Object-Oriented (OO) and Functional Programming (FP) paradigms, Scala is pragmatic and practical with seamless interoperability with Java.
      
      Scala stands for 'Scalable Language' and is designed to scale with the needs and requirements of its users. It is statically typed but with good type inference and style which gives it a dynamic feel similar to Ruby or Python, but with the performance and safety only a statically typed language can provide. This makes it great for a wide range of use-cases, from internal DSLs to large-scale enterprise applications or container code.

      The topic of this presentation is about using Scala programming language with [GridGain ][3] framework to provide a simple and productive cloud computing platform.&nbsp;
      
      Scala is a hybrid function and object-oriented language that is rapidly gaining traction in becoming the &ldquo;next&rdquo; Java in JVM-based language evolution. GridGain is one of the most rapidly growing cloud development platforms for JVM-based languages.
      
      2/3 of the presentation will be devoted to live coding demonstration of writing basic MapReduce application in Scala using GridGain middleware. All coding during demonstration will be done live. Overview of grid and cloud computing concepts as well as notion of Native Cloud Applications will be discussed. Short intro into Scala language will also be provided.
      
      **What problems/challenges will an attendee learn to solve by attending your session?** 
      Attendee will learn how to use Scala - one of the most exciting JVM-based languages - to quickly and efficiently build cloud-enabled applications. They will also learn on how to quickly build simple MapReduce application using GridGain framework.
      
      **What will attendees learn by attending your session?** 
      Attendees will learn:  
      How to build and run simple Scala MapReduce application  
      How to start and configure GridGain  
      How to cloud-enable the existing Scala code using GridGain to run it on the cloud
      
      **Who should attend your session?**

    - Jonas Boner's Akka Workshop
    - London

    - |
      Jonas Boner is a the creator of the open source [Akka project][1] .
      
      Witing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable applications is too hard. Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction. 
      
      Akka is here to change that. Akka is using the Actor Model together with Software Transactional Memory (STM) to raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. For fault-tolerance it adopts the &quot;Let it crash&quot; model which have been used with great success in the Telecom industry to build applications that self-heals, systems that never stop. Akka's Remote Actors, together with the Clustering module, provides the abstraction for transparent distribution, adaptive automatic load-balancing and cluster rebalancing, replication and is the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications. 
      
      In this course you will learn what Akka is, the ideas behind its design and implementation and how it can be used to solve hard real-world problems. It is a practical hand-on course with roughly and equal split between theory sessions and labs.

    - Gojko Adzic's Test Driven Development Workshop, feat Damjan Vujnovic Feb 14-15
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Damjan Vujnovic will join us at Skills Matter to run (Gojko Adzic's) TDD Workshop. This two day workshop on Test Driven Development (TDD) enables you to experience and learn test driven development by doing it. You will be immersed in a realistic TDD project, allowing you to learn the practices and principles of test driven development and try them out in practice. Through facilitated exercises and discussion, you will experience two days of working on an agile test-driven team. You will use and learn basic Test Driven Development practices including unit testing, refactoring and related agile practices such as continuous integration and pair programming. You will understand the reasons behind TDD and experience its benefits first-hand.
      
      By applying what you learn, you will be able to build quality into software from the start, design and develop systems fit for purpose and write code that is easy to maintain and evolve in the future.
      
      The is a completely hands-on workshop with coding straight from the start, interrupted by very short presentations to explain the practices and put things into a wider perspective. It is based on the very latest tools, current knowledge and ideas from the community.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
      
          * Design and develop software driven by tests
          * Protect software from unwanted changes using regression tests
          * Evolve software design with refactoring and TDD
          * Recognise smells in the code and clean them up
          * Capture requirements and specifications as acceptance tests
          * Use executable specifications to drive development
          * Continuously integrate software to get quick feedback about changes
          * Apply best practices and avoid pitfalls of unit and acceptance testing
          * Use MBUnit, Gallio and Moq (.NET/C# developers) or JUnit and Mockito(Java developers)

    - Jan Machacek's Practical Spring Roo Workshop
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Experienced chief architect and Skills Matter regular on all number of Spring courses, Jan is back in the eXchange for a two-day workshop on Spring Roo, and all its intricacies.
      
      Jan will be covering the task Roo sets out to solve, the technical details of the solutions and, perhaps most importantly, the architectural choices Roo makes for you. 
      
      In particular, he will be looking at how to use Roo, how to run the code it produces, and how to modify the code manually as well as using further Roo commands. 
      
      He will be exploring the types of applications Roo allows you to create, including the architectural implications of the Roo applications. At the end of the course, you will be able to: understand when and how to use Roo; create applications in Roo; take the Roo code and extend it either manually or using further Roo commands. You will also gain a good understanding of the core architectural concepts in Roo that you can use in your Roo or Spring applications.
      
      If you are looking for a great introduction to Roo, and how to create robust applications with it, look no further.

    - "In The Brain of Linda Rising: Who do You Trust? Beware of Your Brain"
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - " \n\
      We're happy to announce this free talk by Linda Rising, an international expert and speaker on topics related to patterns, retrospectives, agile development, and the change process, when she travels from USA to London in February.\n\n\
      [This is a FREE talk, but please register here.][1] \n\n\
      Synopsis:\n\
      Cognitive scientists tell us that we are more productive and happier when our behaviour matches our brain\xC2\x92s hard-wiring; when, what we do and why we do it matches the way we have evolved to survive over tens of thousands of years.\n\n\
      One problematic behaviour humans have is that we are hard-wired to instantly decide who we trust. And we generally aren't aware of these decisions\xC2\x97it just happens.\n\n\
      Linda Rising explains that this hard-wired \xC2\x93trust evaluation\xC2\x94 can get in the way of working well with others.\n\n\
      Pairing, the daily stand-up, and close communication with the customer and others outside the team go a long way to overcome our instant evaluation of others. As Linda helps you gain a better understanding of this mechanism in your behaviour and what agile processes can do to help, you are more likely to build better interpersonal relationships and create successful products.\n\n\
      ** More about Linda Rising **\n\
      With a Ph.D. from Arizona State University in the field of object-based design metrics, Linda Rising\xC2\x92s background includes university teaching and industry work in telecommunications, avionics, and tactical weapons systems.\n\n\
      An internationally known presenter on topics related to patterns, retrospectives, agile development, and the change process, Linda is the author of numerous articles and four books\xC2\x97Design Patterns in Communications, The Pattern Almanac 2000, A Patterns Handbook, and Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas, written with Mary Lynn Manns.

    - The London Developer Sessions - Diversity - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      This is our monthly social gathering, which incorporates members of The London Java Community and Graduate Development Communities. This is an informal social evening most of the evening will be spent having ad-hoc informal discussions in small groups, we have added a theme to the evening to make it more interesting for all involved and make it less intimidating for new members.
      
      This month the theme will be around Diversity - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly
      
      Diversity seems to be a hot topic at the moment. With Andy Gray bringing the subject of diversity in sports into the press and our very own Trisha Gee highlighting the difficulties the industry currently faces within diversity, we have dedicated a night to the subject. We have all heard stories about the good benefits of diversity along with the ugly stories of it being handled badly. The theme for this evenings event will involve your thoughts on diverse teams and the benefits diversity can bring to a software development team. We can look at the fact that none of us are average developers,&nbsp;how everyone is different and why that is a good thing in a development team. It is highly recommended that you read Trisha's post on the subject here:&nbsp;[http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/on-how-not-to-target-girl-geeks.html][1] &nbsp;
      
      We have booked out the top floor of the Porterhouse in Covent Garden [http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html][2] , the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world. The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 &ndash; 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights. This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.

    - LSUG Scala Dojo
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      A new regular dojo session is been run every third Thursday of the month (for now).
      
      The dojo will help anyone interested in Scala to gain a greater appreciation of the language as well as practical experience solving a problem with Scala code.  The current problem is to implement a model of a Minesweeper board.
      
      Project information and code is being hosted on the Assembla.com site (a bit like project kenai, github, etc).  You can view [more information about lsug-dojo and the projects being tackled][1]  and also [get a copy of the dojo code from the assembla git repository][2] .
      
      A laptop will be provided with the [development environment][3]  ready to use.
      
      Each person will have the opportunity to do 10 minutes of work on the tests and code, paired with a co-pilot.  After 10 minutes the co-pilot will take over the keyboard and a new person will volunteer to be co-pilot. 
      
      The audience will be supplying lots of positive and constructive comments and suggestions and it is therefore beneficial that you share your thoughts with the audience as you work.
      
      If you have any comments, please add them on the meetup.com site.  If you want to discuss things in more detail you can start a thread in the messages tab of the lsug-dojo site.

    - Udi Dahan's Advanced Distributed Systems Design with SOA Course
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "Udi Dahan will be back with us in February, to give his incredibly popular and inspiring workshop on Advanced Distributed Systems Design, communication patterns and his ideas on designing large-scale distributed systems, DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, messaging and NServiceBus. \n\n\
      Only attend this workshop if you are prepared to challenge your beliefs and be open to new ways of thinking (really!)\n\n\
      The Advanced Distributed Systems Design with SOA will help you take the pain out of designing large-scale distributed systems. New technologies make it easier to comply with today\xC2\x92s communications and security standards, but they won't magically provide you with a robust and scalable system.  This course is packed with the wisdom of companies like SUN, Amazon and EBay.\n\n\
      Tried-and-true theories and fallacies will be shown, helping you to avoid costly mistakes. Communications patterns like publish/subscribe and correlated one-way request/response will be demonstrated, in conjunction with advanced object-oriented state management practices for long-running workflows. If you enjoy deep architectural discussion, if you are in charge of building a large-scale distributed system, and if you want to know more about how the big guys run their systems, sign up for this workshop!\n\n\
      Modules:\n\
      1:  Distributed Systems Theory\n\
      2:  Coupling: Platform, Temporal, &amp; Spatial\n\
      3:  Asynchronous Messaging Patterns\n\
      4:  Bus &amp; Broker Architectural Styles\n\
      5:  SOA Building Blocks\n\
      6:  Scalability and Flexibility\n\
      7:  Long running processes\n\
      8:  Service / Autonomous Component Solution Structure\n\
      9:  Service Layer \xC2\x96 Domain Model Interaction\n\
      10: Creating High-Performance Domain Models\n\
      11: Web Services and User Interfaces\n\
      12: Case Study\n\n\
      About Udi Dahan\n\
      Udi Dahan is an internationally renowned expert on software architecture and design. Recognized with the coveted \xC2\x93Most Valuable Professional\xC2\x94 award by Microsoft Corporation for solutions architecture and connected systems 4 years in a row, Udi is also the creator of NServiceBus, and on the advisory board of Microsoft\xC2\x92s next generation technology platforms: WCF/WF/OSLO, the Software Factories Initiative, and the Composite Application Library &amp; Guidance.\n\n\

    - Robert Pickering's Beginning F# Workshop - March 16-17th
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "Robert Pickering is joining us from Paris for the Functional Programming eXchange conference, which we will be running this March... Whilst he's here, he'll also run this Beginning F# Workshop, which  is a two day course that will teach you all about F#, an exciting new language that has evolved from a Microsoft Research project into a first class citizen of Visual Studio 2010. You will discover how F# can be used to express programs concisely and efficiently; you\xC2\x92ll also learn how to start having fun with this enormously productive language.\n\n\
      This F# course will start with an introduction to F# and functional programming. It will show you how to use F#\xC2\x92s powerful immutable data structures to reduce the amount of mutable state your programs require. You'll look at how functions can be used to build complex solutions by composing a number of simple and elegant building blocks. You will also learn how F# allows you to easily mix functional programming with both object oriented and imperative style programming.\n\n\
      As the course progresses will you will learn, though a mixture of presentations and hands on labs, how to use F# to do both asynchronous and parallel programming. You'll look at advance parallel programming by message passing between agents. You'll then move on to using DSLs and language oriented techniques to increase programmer productivity. Finally, you\xC2\x92ll look at how a combination of DSLs, meta and parallel programming can be used to run certain kinds of algorithms on the GPU, greatly increasing their performance.\n\n\

      Android tablets have arrived, and according to manufacturers they are here to stay. Although Android does a great job in ensuring that your apps function on tablets without extra work. To not take advantage of this extra screen real estate and power, however, would be a real shame.
      
      Let's get together and talk about the new issues, and more importantly new prospects, that come with this territory.
      
      Android is in dire need of great design patterns and creative design. As developers we need to think outside of the mobile phone box we have become comfortable with.

    - David Laribee's Managing Technical Debt Workshop
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |+
      David Laribee will be comign to The Skills Matter eXchange to present a one day workshop on 'Managing Technical Debt'.
      
      Technical debt is a real drag on productivity and every team suffers from it. The good news is that this debt can be paid back over time and managed when a team is willing to put a system in place. This workshop demonstrates how to build a system for managing and reducing debt using a Lean/Agile process. 
      
       Participants will also leave with a full toolkit of techniques for fixing debt. Demonstrations are provided in a mix of .NET, Java and Ruby.
      
      You will learn how to:
      
      Identify the highest interest debt, the real productivity killers.
      
      Present your managers and customers with a rock solid case for fixing debt.
      
      Build consensus in your team on opportunities for improvement.
      
      Simplify complicated code. Confidently change error-prone code.
      
      Use an Agile process and software metrics to sustain improvement.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      David Laribee is a leading expert in designing and developing enterprise applications and coaching Lean/agile teams. He is also a regular speaker at local and national devleoper events and is the co-founder of The ALT.NET movement.

      Steve Freeman, pioneer of Agile software development in the UK and presenter and organizer at various international industry conferences and Nat Pryce, author of &quot;Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests&quot; and developer of the jMock mock-object library, will be at Skills Matter holding an in depth and informative 2 day course on the practices of Test Driven Development.
      
      This 2 day Test-Driven Development course shows how to use tests to guide the development of software. We show how to apply this critical skill, using test friction to show us where the boundaries in the code should be so that we can write expressive, coherent code.
      
      We also show how TDD works at the larger scale, helping us build reliable systems that fit into the usual soup of third-party services. In particular, we address working with asynchrony and distribution.
      
      If you are an experienced developer and you want to learn how to use TDD to write expressive, coherent code for reliable systems, this Growing Real Systems Guided by Tests course is for you!

      **Event descritption**
      
      Following on from the Open Source Jumpstart in April 2010 we are running another event in a series designed to introduce the most common Open  Source tools encountered as a professional developer at work or when  contributing to OSS projects. The series will show how the concepts  taught at University in computing science and software engineering  modules can be applied effectively with Open Source tools and help  establish a highly agile approach to the whole software development  cycle. No previous knowledge of open source tools is required as the  series will provide practical examples of open source tool use, war  stories and experience gained from using each tool. So, if you've ever  wondered - "How does that Software Engineering concept actually get  applied in the workplaces?" this series can help you find out
      
      Version control is one of the first tools you need for software development and its important to know what your options are.&nbsp; The way we develop software is constantly evolving and the tools we use adapt to keep up with new practices.&nbsp; Version control is no exception and there has been a great interested in (going back to) distributed version control with the likes of Git, Mecurial and Bazzar.
      
      In this session we will compare and contrast centralised and distributed approaches and how choice of tools can affect the way you work as a development team.&nbsp; The session will include "follow-along" examples of using distributed version control to its natural conclusion of using online public repositories.&nbsp; Examples will be shown of open source projects and from London coding dojos.
      
      
      * 1.5 hour plus talk & workshop on
      &nbsp;- setting up subversion / git
      &nbsp;- creating a project - check in / out
      &nbsp;- version control theory - branching & merging
      &nbsp;- using online repositories - github / assembla.com
      &nbsp;- centrailsed vs distributed repositories 
      &nbsp;- bring your laptop to join in the exercises

    - Greg Young will run a 3-day workshop on CQRS, Domain Events Event Sourcing & DDD
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      International conference speaker, codebetter.com-writer and DDD &amp; CQRS expert Greg Young, will run a 3-day workshop in London on CQRS, Domain Events, Event Sourcing and how to apply DDD.
      
      Join this workshop, spend 3 intensive days in a room with Greg and learn all about system building and architectures with Domain Driven Design.
      
      The largest problem many run into with Domain Driven Design is in getting the abstract concepts implemented in a concrete way. Many of the stereotypical architectures people use actually make it impossible to apply DDD.
      
      Greg's course will help you avoid this by teaching you all about Command Query Separation (CQRS), Domain Events, Event Sourcing and how to effectively apply DDD within an organisation.

    - The London Developer Sessions - Let's talk about Concurrency
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      This is our monthly social gathering, which incorporates members of The London Java Community and Graduate Development Communities. This is an informal social evening most of the evening will be spent having ad-hoc informal discussions in small groups. We usually keep to a them for the event and this month it will be based around Concurrency. Following on from last months event in which we saw record numbers of signups - We will have some members in attendance with a variety of experience on different aspects of Concurrency in Java so it's a great chance to come along and discuss any problems you've been having, or solutions you've found within Concurrency. It will all be in an informal discussion setting with no prearranged presentations.
      
      We have booked out the top floor of the Porterhouse in Covent Garden [][1] [][2] [][3] [http://www.porterhous][4] ..., the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world.
      
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 &ndash; 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights.
      
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Agile team members create their own rules, based on constraints imposed by the environment. But something else is needed for good results: some call it discipline, craftsmanship, or competence. Traffic management teaches us that there are 7 approaches to achieving competence in a self-organizing system. We are going to look at all of them.
      
      This session deals with craftsmanship. Everybody knows it is important, but few know what an organization (and management) should do to support and promote craftsmanship when projects are run by self-organizing teams. Objectives:
      
          * How to develop competence with 7 organizational approaches
          * How to optimize the whole measuring performance on multiple levels
          * How to optimize the whole measuring performance in multiple dimensions
          * The differences between managing, coaching, and mentoring
          * How to use social pressure and adaptive tools to support competence
      
      If you would like to join this free talk, please let us know by [registering on the Skills Matter website][1] , in addition to your Meetup RSVP, so we know you are coming.[ Find out more here][2]

Also, SSL has traditionally added overhead to the process and as such may not be used in cases when it really should be - perhaps due to the perceived overhead, or perhaps due to the difficulty in deploying to an environment. What we're looking to discuss is the fundamentals: a) what is the problem if we're not using SSL?"

    - Give your JavaScript some Backbone
    - Tampa
    - United States
    - Web applications continue to have greater emphasis placed on JavaScript to allow complex behavior that is simple, intuitive and visually attractive to the user. Many Web application developers fell in love with jQuery as it largely resolved browser quirks and provided a fun way to manipulate the DOM. Yet, jQuery does not provide a convention for JavaScript and can easily lead to spaghetti code and a messy application with lots of repetition on intermingled concerns.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |+
      Rick Evan's will be coming to Skills Matter to give a&nbsp; 2 day course on Clustered Caching with Oracle Coherence. The aim of the course is to provide both an overview of Oracle Coherence and a deep dive into the  more technical aspects of this exciting technology.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      Oracle Coherence is a Java, .NET, and C++ enabled clustered caching and  data grid technology that delivers high availability, rapid performance  and extreme scalability. You will learn the theory of caching and  various caching techniques, and you will gain a good understanding of  the capabilities of Oracle Coherence.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      After completing the course, you will know when and how each of the different caching options and  features should be used. You will be able to take full advantage of all  of the available functionality within Coherence, and you will know how  to use it to achieve exceptional data caching performance for highly  demanding data intensive and transactional applications.

    - Would anyone be interested in having some sort of regular mixer/networking meeting? It would be an opportunity for group members to have a few drinks, share a few stories on what they've been working on. I'm thinking it would be an informal way for members to stay connected and engaged withone another without a lot of pressure to the group moderators to line up guest speakers/presenters.

    - LSUG Scala Dojo
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      A new regular dojo session is been run every third Thursday of the month (for now).
      
      The dojo will help anyone interested in Scala to gain a greater appreciation of the language as well as practical experience solving a problem with Scala code.  A problem will be chosen on the night of the dojo by the group, you can also suggest a problem on the evening.
      
      Project information and code is being hosted on the Assembla.com site (a bit like project kenai, github, etc).  You can view [more information about lsug-dojo and the projects being tackled][1]  and also [get a copy of the dojo code from the assembla git repository][2] .
      
      If you can, please bring a laptop with you with a Scala&nbsp;[development environment][3]  ready to use.
      
      We will be using the new format for the dojo, where everyone spilts up into groups of 3 or 4 people. &nbsp;This allows you to keep a better understanding of what is going on and helps you learn the most Scala stuff.
      
      There will be an opportunity to talk about your ideas and approach to solving a problem in Scala at the end of the session.
      
      If you have any comments, please add them on the meetup.com site.  If you want to discuss things in more detail you can start a thread in the messages tab of the lsug-dojo site.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "Over the last two decades, commodity hardware has changed\r\n\
      dramatically. In parallel, Big Data, NOSQL and other non-relational\r\n\
      stores are becoming mainstream. Yet these applications access hardware\r\n\
      via a legacy storage stack \xE2\x80\x93 FS, buffer cache, LVM, RAID \xE2\x80\x93 built for\r\n\
      the hardware and applications of the 80s. Acunu is rewriting the\r\n\
      storage stack for these applications and today's hardware, and at the\r\n\
      same time deploying some very new algorithms and techniques.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      We'll give some background to Acunu, a bit about our algorithms, and\r\n\
      discuss how developers can make use of it, and why you should want if\r\n\
      you're dealing with enterprise deployments.\r\n\

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Hands-on software architect and international speaker Simon Brown will run this 4-day practical course about building software within an enterprise environment - in a structured, lightweight and pragmatic way. It covers the complete end-to-end software development process; from planning, gathering requirements and software architecture through to the effective use of source code control, automated unit testing, continuous integration and load testing.
      
      Pragmatic enterprise software development is about taking the best bits from traditional and modern approaches, blending them together to form a structured yet lightweight approach to building software that's appropriate to the way that your organisation works. This is what the course is all about.

    - What do you think of creating a simple project that requires multiple meetups but that is broad enough to allow us to explore different technologies or ideas.For example, doing a small server side app (really really simple) and on another meeting doing a simple Android client and then, who knows, iPhone and Win 7 Phone.In the end we would have a good understanding of the differences between those platforms and it's easy to compare them.

This will be a chance to meet with some senior developers to find out what they would advise about getting into the industry. It is an informal social evening with no agenda - most of the evening will be spent having ad-hoc informal discussions in small groups.\n\n\
      We have booked out the top floor of [the Porterhouse ][1] in Covent Garden [http://www.porterhous...][2] , the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world. \n\n\
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 \xC2\x96 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights. \n\n\
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n  [2]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n"

    - London
    - United Kingdom, United Kingdom
    - "Over the last two decades, commodity hardware has changed dramatically. In parallel, Big Data, NOSQL and other non-relational stores are becoming mainstream. Yet these applications access hardware via a legacy storage stack \xE2\x80\x93 FS, buffer cache, LVM, RAID \xE2\x80\x93 built for the hardware and applications of the 80s. Acunu is rewriting the storage stack for these applications and today's hardware, and at the same time deploying some very new algorithms and techniques."

      Strategic Elements for Successful Performance Testing
      
      &bull; Why does an app, successfully tested, exhibit poor performance characteristics in production?
      
      &bull; Why does a typical performance testing approach fail?
      
      &bull; How to forecast potential performance failures?
      
      &bull; How to reduce risk and improve cost effectiveness?
      
      The answer to these lies in identifying the strategic elements that might be missing from your approach! Date: Feb 25, 2011 (10 am PT / 1 pm ET) Learn more about the session at:&nbsp;[][1] [[http://bit.ly/hUU3GM][2] ][3]

    - Gojko Adzic's Test Driven Development Workshop, feat Damjan Vujnovic April 18-19
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Damjan Vujnovic will join us at Skills Matter to run (Gojko Adzic's) TDD Workshop. This two day workshop on Test Driven Development (TDD) enables you to experience and learn test driven development by doing it. You will be immersed in a realistic TDD project, allowing you to learn the practices and principles of test driven development and try them out in practice. Through facilitated exercises and discussion, you will experience two days of working on an agile test-driven team. You will use and learn basic Test Driven Development practices including unit testing, refactoring and related agile practices such as continuous integration and pair programming. You will understand the reasons behind TDD and experience its benefits first-hand.
      
      By applying what you learn, you will be able to build quality into software from the start, design and develop systems fit for purpose and write code that is easy to maintain and evolve in the future.
      
      The is a completely hands-on workshop with coding straight from the start, interrupted by very short presentations to explain the practices and put things into a wider perspective. It is based on the very latest tools, current knowledge and ideas from the community.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
      
          * Design and develop software driven by tests
          * Protect software from unwanted changes using regression tests
          * Evolve software design with refactoring and TDD
          * Recognise smells in the code and clean them up
          * Capture requirements and specifications as acceptance tests
          * Use executable specifications to drive development
          * Continuously integrate software to get quick feedback about changes
          * Apply best practices and avoid pitfalls of unit and acceptance testing
          * Use MBUnit, Gallio and Moq (.NET/C# developers) or JUnit and Mockito(Java developers)

    - Antony Marcano, Andy Palmer & Chris Matts' Feature Injection Course
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Andy Palmer, software craftsman, coach, consultant and developer has worked in technology for 10 years on high-availability systems for the mobile telecommunications industry and as a coach with a prestigious Agile consultancy.
      
      Antony Marcano has 13 years of industry experience, originally specialising in software testing, the last 8 of which as a practitioner on Agile projects. Now, more often as a coach and trainer, Antony helps teams evolve their skills and abilities to attain the benefits offered by agile practices.
      
      Chris Matts has over 10 years of experience in investment banking including strategy work as a practitioner rather than as a consultant. His specialist areas are real options, IT risk management, business value and agile analysis
      
      These forward thinkers within the Agile community will be returning to Skills Matter to deliver an engaging 2 day course on Feature Injection.
      
      Feature Injection is the answer to the question &quot;how do we effectively perform business analysis on agile projects?&quot; It is a collection of harvested practices and soft-skills that, when combined, rapidly bring about a shared understanding between the business visionaries and the implementation team. It helps determine which aspects of a new product concept or product enhancement will add the most value to the organisation. It also connects cleanly with Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
      
      In this 2 day course, developed in conjunction with Chris Matts, the inventor of Feature Injection, you will learn how this method enables and enhances agile business analysis.
      
      If you are a Business Analyst,Tester, Developer, Product Owner, Project Manager or a Scrum Master then this Feature Injection course is for you!

      Google Web Toolkit is not just another monolithic Web application  framework. It is a modularized Java to JavaScript compiler supplied  together with Web application development appliances.
      
       This talk  gives an overview of modern styles of web development and shows how GWT  fits into picture and what to expect from that in the nearest future.
      
       You will learn what GWT provides for you from web application  development and performance optimization perspectives. You will also  learn how GWT compiler works internally and how you could tune it for  your specific needs. After the presentation you should have pretty solid  technical overview of what GWT is  really  about and whether you need it in your next project.

    - How to decrease risk when designing integrated systems with Sarah Taraporewalla
    - Poplar
    - United Kingdom
    - How often do you get to work on completely isolated systems? It is seemingly more and more common that your system needs to talk to another system to function, whether that be a legacy system, an external API or even one that has not been developed yet. Every system that you talk to adds risk to your project; technical risk, quality risk and delivery risk. But never fear - help is at hand.

    - Modern Java Concurrency

      ********IMPORTANT ********** SkillsMatter are hosting this event and are handling the attendance it is essential that you confirm your place at this link: [][1] [][2] [][3] [][4] [][5] [][6] [http://skillsmatter.com/event/java-jee/modern-java-concurrency/rl-890][7] 
      
      During the event, we will have two main technical presentations around concurrency which will be preceded by 3-4 of lightning talks from our members.
      
      **BEN EVANS** - Clock speed and performance are no longer increasing as spectacularly as they once did. Instead the focus has turned to more cores per chip.
      
      This talk provides a unique perspective on the Java concurrency landscape as it exists today (both "classic" and java.util.concurrent), and some pointers towards the future of concurrency across the platform.
      
      **MICHAEL BARKER** - How to Do 100K TPS at Less than&nbsp;1ms Latency
      
      Conventional wisdom says that memory is fast, disk is slow, networks are slower and that fast systems must be highly concurrent to achieve maximum performance. Much of this is outdated and some of it is now wrong.
      Modern hardware is phenomenally fast, but we have become complacent and use it in extremely inefficient and inappropriate ways. 
      
      For world class performance on commodity hardware you need to take a holistic approach to software design. The good news is that all the stuff we learned in computer science 101 is what really matters, choose your data structures carefully, model your domain, understand your platform, work hard to have a clear separation of concerns, but as well as all of that, run your business logic on a single thread!? 
      
      Mike Barker works for the London Multi-Asset Exchange (LMAX) and are building one of the world's fastest trading platforms using a radical new architecture that takes it all back to basics.
      This session will describe some of the challenges faced when developing the worlds fastest financial exchange - little things like how to do over 100K/tps at less than 1ms latency yet still have full HA support in a distributed environment.

    - Robert Schneider's Mission Critical Service Testing Using soapUI Pro
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Robert D. Schneider, senior consultant and trainer. He has provided distributed computing, database optimization, and other technical expertise to a wide variety of enterprises in the financial, technology, and government sectors, and author of six books and numerous articles on advanced technical topics such as Cloud Computing, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), open source, and relational database design/optimization.
      
      Robert will be at Skills Matter this spring to deliver an engaging seminar on Mission Critical Service Testing.
      
      This two day course will teach you how to use the powerful capabilities of soapUI Pro to answer important questions prior to placing these services into production.
      
      In an effort to streamline development and boost productivity, many enterprises are deploying Web, REST, and other types of software services. Unfortunately, very few of these organizations are performing effective, comprehensive tests to ensure that these new, vital services are up to the challenge. The class is structured around the highly regarded 7 Fundamentals of Mission-Critical Service Testing methodology.
      
      If you are a Software Developer or Architect, QA Tester, IT Manager or Web Professional who wants to learn how to employ test automation to improve the quality of your software projects, this course is for you!

    - Jonas Boner's Pragmatic Real-World Scala
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Jonas Boner is a the creator of Akka project.
      
      Jonas Boner's two day Pragmatic Real-World Scala course will teach you all you need to know about Scala, one of the most interesting new languages for the JVM. A unique and elegant blend of the Object-Oriented (OO) and Functional Programming (FP) paradigms, Scala is pragmatic and practical with seamless interoperability with Java.
      
      Scala stands for 'Scalable Language' and is designed to scale with the needs and requirements of its users. It is statically typed but with good type inference and style which gives it a dynamic feel similar to Ruby or Python, but with the performance and safety only a statically typed language can provide. This makes it great for a wide range of use-cases, from internal DSLs to large-scale enterprise applications or container code.

    - |
      Jonas Boner's Akka Workshop
      
      We believe that writing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable applications is too hard. Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction.
      
      Akka is here to change that. Akka is using the Actor Model together with Software Transactional Memory (STM) to raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. For fault-tolerance it adopts the &quot;Let it crash&quot; model which have been used with great success in the Telecom industry to build applications that self-heals, systems that never stop. Akka's Remote Actors, together with the Clustering module, provides the abstraction for transparent distribution, adaptive automatic load-balancing and cluster rebalancing, replication and is the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.
      
      In this course you will learn what Akka is, the ideas behind its design and implementation and how it can be used to solve hard real-world problems. It is a practical hand-on course with roughly and equal split between theory sessions and labs.

    - In The Brain of Alan Shalloway, Applying Lean Software Development Principles
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |+
      Alan Shalloway, author of the Lean-Agile Enterprise Release Planning course will be delivering a free talk to our community over Skype.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      While first generation agile methods have a solid track record at the team level, many agile transformations get stuck trying to expand throughout the organization. With a set of principles that can help improve software development quality and productivity, lean thinking provides a method for escaping the trap of local optimization.
      
      &nbsp;
      
      While agile teams can use lean principles to improve their practices, the larger organization can embrace lean to solve problems that commonly plague company-wide agile endeavours. Alan Shalloway explores the lean principles of mapping value streams, creating visibility, managing work levels, and more. Together these lean principles and practices can help your organization dramatically reduce the amount of waste in the work teams perform. Alan introduces and explains Kanban, an agile method that has recently come on the scene, in terms of the lean principles it supports.

    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Entrance is the half way along Gordon Street. &nbsp;Please take a look at the [UCL campus map][1]  to help get your bearings.
      
      This event will give you an introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD), a standard practice for development projects in industry and is also used in many open source projects. Having an appreciation of TDD and being able to talk about the values it brings will help you stand out from the crowd and impress prospective employers and it will also help you work with the people in your team when you get that job.
      
      The tooling up series aims to give junior developers and graduates understanding of the common software tools and practices used in Industry, helping you get a good start with your career.
      
      Employers look for those candidates that know how to practically apply the learning gained from University without spending time and money training them on the tools they use. &nbsp;The more experience you have of the tools used in industry, then you are more likely to turn your degree into a career. &nbsp;The "tooling up" series gives you a kick start on that road and presents a wealth of experience from experts in the industry, conveying the essential information you need to help secure a job.

    - HTML5(with Mark Embling)HTML5 is the latest iteration of the HTML standard we've all come to know and (possibly) love. So what has changed, what is new and what might this mean for us as web devs? This talk intends to answer these questions by giving a broad overview of HTML5, with a focus on the various new elements and APIs and what they abilities they give us.Mark works as a software developer for the Sixth Form College Farnborough.

    - Jurgen Appelo's Agile Management, 31st March - 1st April, 2011
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - Agile management is an often overlooked part of Agile. There is much information available for agile developers, testers, and project managers, but very little for development managers and team leaders. However, when organizations adopt agile software development, not only developers, testers, and project managers need to learn new practices. Development managers and team leaders also need to learn a new approach to leading and managing agile organizations.

    - EC1V 7DP
    - United Kingdom
    - "With the cost of a university education going through the roof its unsurprising that many junior developers find they lack the skills required by industry. Many large organisations simply rely on hiring lots of commodity developers to get work done: focussing on quantity not quality. This easily becomes a case of the blind leading the blind; with yesterday's mistakes being repeated all over again by a fresh generation of developers with no sense of history."

      We have booked out the top floor of the Porterhouse in Covent Garden [][1] [][2] [][3] [http://www.porterhous][4] ..., the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world.
      
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 &ndash; 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights.
      
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.

    - Jutta Eckstein's Agile Software Development in the Large
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Jutta Eckstein, author and speaker will be at Skillsmatter holding this 1 day course on Agile Software Development for Distributed Teams.
      
      A lot of people still believe that agile software development is for small teams only. However, the agile value system and the principles behind as stated in the agile manifesto don't argue about team or project size. Furthermore the projects Jutta has normally working on are typically large, distributed and mission-critical.
      
      Therefore, several years ago, she took the challenge and tried agile software development in the large. Meanwhile she came to the same conclusion on many large projects: Also large and even distributed teams can benefit from a value system that is beneficial for small teams.
      
      Jutta Eckstein is an independent coach, consultant and trainer, her know-how in agile processes is based on over ten years experience in developing object-oriented applications. She has helped many teams and organizations all over the world to make the transition to an agile approach. She has a unique experience in applying agile processes within medium-sized to large distributed mission-critical projects. This is also the topic of her books 'Agile Software Development in the Large' and 'Agile Software Development with Distributed Teams'.

      *Russ Miles, who was to do next months lsug talk, has had to cancel and we hope he can do it at a latter date. 
       This gives us a chance to do something different for next month. If we can get three or four people to volunteer to so a short talk, this could be a lightning talk or something a bit longer say 20 mins, then we will do that in April. The subject can be anything providing it has come connection to scala, from 'This is the project I'm working on', 'I like this package', or 'this is how I solved a problem' its up to you. 
       If you want a short talk on something then email the group, you may be luck and somebody may know it and want that little push to do something. 
       Also if you can think of something else that could fit in with this format for next month, and willing to help make it work. then, again, email the group and we'll see if we can add it to the evening. 
       Hope that sounds interesting&nbsp; andy*

    - Tom and Mary Poppendieck's Lean Software Development Leaders Workshop
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "World leaders Tom and Mary Poppendieck will be arriving at Skillsmatter to give this exciting talk on Lean Software Development.\n\n\
      As global competitiveness comes to the software development industry, the search is on for a better way to create first-class software rapidly, repeatedly, and reliably. Lean initiatives in manufacturing, logistics, and services have led to dramatic improvements in cost, quality and delivery time; can they do the same for software development? The short answer is \xC2\x93Absolutely!\xC2\x94\n\n\
      Of the many methods that have arisen to improve software development, Lean is emerging as one that is grounded in decades of work understanding how to make processes better. Lean thinking focuses on giving customers what they want, when and where the want it, without a wasted motion or wasted minute.\n\n\
      This intensive two day workshop aimed at leaders will help you apply lean principles such as Rapid Response, Constant Learning, Built-in Quality, Local Responsibility and Global Optimization to software development.\n\n\
      If you want to learn first hand from Lean thought-leaders Mary and Tom Poppendieck how to apply Lean Principles to your organization, this Lean Software Development Leaders Workshop is for you!\n\n\
      Mary Poppendieck started her career as a process control programmer, moved on to manage the IT department of a manufacturing plant, and then ended up in product development, where she was both a product champion and department manager.\n\n\
      Over the past several years, Mary lectures and teaches classes with her husband Tom. Based on their on-going learning, they wrote a second book, Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash in 2006, and a third, Leading Lean Software Development: Results are Not the Point in 2009. A popular writer and speaker, Mary continues to bring fresh perspectives to the world of software development  \n\n\

    - How can craftsmanship move the industry forwards?
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - " With  the cost of a university education going through the roof its  unsurprising that many junior developers find they lack the skills  required by industry. Many large organisations simply rely on hiring  lots of commodity developers to get work done: focussing on quantity not  quality. This easily becomes a case of the blind leading the blind;  with yesterday's mistakes being repeated all over again by a fresh  generation of developers with no sense of history.&nbsp;Coupled with this,  the reality for many talented, experienced developers is they find  management roles more lucrative - depriving the next generation of  developers of their experience. \n\n\
      Into this the Software Craftsmanship movement  emerges - bringing the focus back to the people that build the world's  software: developers. By focussing on improving individual skill and  sharing expertise with the next generation, this offers industry a  chance to reverse this trend, to raise the bar of the whole industry and  delight customers with the software we produce. \n\n\
      In this panel discussion some of the leading lights  of the Software Craftsmanship movement will answer your questions on the  state of the industry; how can great developers differentiate  themselves? How can they help the next generation develop? How can we  demonstrate our value to potential employers and customers? Where does  the industry go from here? \n\n It's our pleasure to announce that our panel discussion will be composed by: \n\n **Dave Hoover:** Chief Craftsman at Obtiva; Principal in @[obtiva][1]  and @[madmimi][2] ; Author of @[apprenticeshipp][3] ;\n Twitter:[ @redsquirrel][4]  \n [http://redsquirrel.com/dave][5]  \n\n **Dan North**: Developer, Agile coach, technologist, troublemaker.

    - Introduction to Lua
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |-
      Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
      
      Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
      
      This introduction is by Matthew Wild who has developed an XMPP server in Lua called Prosody. He'll be introducing Lua and talking about his experience developing for it.

    - Introduction to Lua
    - London
    - United Kingdom, United Kingdom
    - Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.

    - The London Developer Sessions
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "This is our monthly social gathering, which incorporates members of The London Java Community and Graduate Development Communities. This will be a chance to meet with some senior developers to find out what they would advise about getting into the industry. It is an informal social evening with no agenda - most of the evening will be spent having ad-hoc informal discussions in small groups.\n\n\
      We have booked out the top floor of [the Porterhouse ][1] in Covent Garden [http://www.porterhous...][2] , the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world. \n\n\
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 \xC2\x96 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights. \n\n\
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n  [2]: http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/coventgarden.html\n"

    - Greg Young will run a 3-day workshop on CQRS, Domain Events Event Sourcing & DDD
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      International conference speaker, codebetter.com-writer and DDD &amp; CQRS expert Greg Young, will run a 3-day workshop in London on CQRS, Domain Events, Event Sourcing and how to apply DDD.
      
      Join this workshop, spend 3 intensive days in a room with Greg and learn all about system building and architectures with Domain Driven Design.
      
      The largest problem many run into with Domain Driven Design is in getting the abstract concepts implemented in a concrete way. Many of the stereotypical architectures people use actually make it impossible to apply DDD.
      
      Greg's course will help you avoid this by teaching you all about Command Query Separation (CQRS), Domain Events, Event Sourcing and how to effectively apply DDD within an organisation.

    - John Smart's Java Power Tools Bootcamp
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Have you read the Java Power Tools book (O'Reilly)?
      
      The author John Smart will be flying over from New Zealand to run the Java Power Tools Bootcamp!
      
      This is a comprehensive, innovative and hands-on workshop covering best-of-breed open source tools and techniques for Agile Development in Java. Learn how to optimise your development process, hone your programming skills and know-how, and ultimately produce better software. And have fun while you're doing it!
      
      The course is an intensive 5-day workshop, with a mixture of teaching and lab exercises. You will learn how to implement modern Agile best practices for Java development within your own organisation. Each day starts with a discussion of Agile development practices and covers what tools and techniques you can use to support these practices.
      
      LEARN HOW TO:
      
          * Use Maven effectively to improve your development productivity and code quality, promote better software architecture, and improve team communication.
          * Understand the issues around dependency management in Java development, and be able to implement declarative dependency management in a corporate environment.
          * Know how to write effective unit tests and understand how to use unit testing practices to write more reliable code faster.
          * Understand how to use Behaviour-Driven Development to write better designed, more maintainable and more reliable code.

    - Udi Dahan's Advanced Distributed Systems Design with SOA Course (June 13-17)
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - "Udi Dahan will be back with us in June for the DDD eXchange and, whilst here he'll also run his incredibly popular and inspiring workshop on Advanced Distributed Systems Design, communication patterns and his ideas on designing large-scale distributed systems, DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, messaging and NServiceBus. \n\n\
      Only attend this workshop if you are prepared to challenge your beliefs and be open to new ways of thinking (really!)\n\n\
      The Advanced Distributed Systems Design with SOA will help you take the pain out of designing large-scale distributed systems. New technologies make it easier to comply with today\xC2\x92s communications and security standards, but they won't magically provide you with a robust and scalable system.  This course is packed with the wisdom of companies like SUN, Amazon and EBay.\n\n\
      Tried-and-true theories and fallacies will be shown, helping you to avoid costly mistakes. Communications patterns like publish/subscribe and correlated one-way request/response will be demonstrated, in conjunction with advanced object-oriented state management practices for long-running workflows. If you enjoy deep architectural discussion, if you are in charge of building a large-scale distributed system, and if you want to know more about how the big guys run their systems, sign up for this workshop!\n\n\
      Modules:\n\
      1:  Distributed Systems Theory\n\
      2:  Coupling: Platform, Temporal, &amp; Spatial\n\
      3:  Asynchronous Messaging Patterns\n\
      4:  Bus &amp; Broker Architectural Styles\n\
      5:  SOA Building Blocks\n\
      6:  Scalability and Flexibility\n\
      7:  Long running processes\n\
      8:  Service / Autonomous Component Solution Structure\n\
      9:  Service Layer \xC2\x96 Domain Model Interaction\n\
      10: Creating High-Performance Domain Models\n\
      11: Web Services and User Interfaces\n\
      12: Case Study\n\n\
      About Udi Dahan\n\
      Udi Dahan is an internationally renowned expert on software architecture and design. Recognized with the coveted \xC2\x93Most Valuable Professional\xC2\x94 award by Microsoft Corporation for solutions architecture and connected systems 4 years in a row, Udi is also the creator of NServiceBus, and on the advisory board of Microsoft\xC2\x92s next generation technology platforms: WCF/WF/OSLO, the Software Factories Initiative, and the Composite Application Library &amp; Guidance.\n\n\

    - Practical Agile Testing with Janet Gregory (3 days)
    - London
    - United Kingdom
    - |
      Globe-trotting Agile expert Janet Gregory is back in the Skills Matter eXchange for a three-day practical agile testing course, demonstrating how testers can become valued agile team-members, how they can contribute to delivering a continuous stream of business value, and provide a way to overcome common cultural and logistical obstacles in transitioning to an agile development process. The course will describe the values and principles that help testers adopt an Agile QA mindset, and how the whole team can contribute to the successes of any testing practices, including test automation. 
      
      She will show how to complete testing activities in short iterations, and how testers can contribute on a daily basis during each iteration and release cycle. Through interactive exercises and group discussions, delegates will discover good strategies for driving development with both executable and manual tests. The course is filled with real-life examples of the many ways agile testers can add value. 
      
      Please also note that all delegates receive a complimentary copy of &quot;Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams&quot; authored by Janet Gregory and Lisa Crispin when attending this training course!

But we will be having fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun getting ready for the weekend. And the next day is a bank holiday, so that counts, RIGHT? So, come one, come all! We'll be sitting in rows passing ones and zeroes down a conveyor belt to communicate. Or we might drink beer and have a chat instead.

    - London E1 7JF

    - Building on the ideas behind Linked Data & the Semantic Web, and the great work of the BBC /programmes team, I've been looking into how we can use a similar approach to model narrative. By using URIs to identify characters and key events in drama, perhaps we can build up 'constellations' of URIs which enable us to tell stories in a truly web-native form. And of course, what works for narrative in drama, may well work for Sport and News.

      One of the May London Tester Gathering will be on Thursday 5th May at The Shooting Star.
      
      Address: Function Room 125-129 Middlesex Street London E1 7JF 0207 929 6818
      
      The plan: We have the function room from 5pm onwards. I will be there from 5:30 onwards.
      
      There will probably be 4-6 Mozillians at the event including Dave Hunt, Matt Evans (Director of QA), and the lead QAs for both Desktop and Mobile.
      
      There will be no formal presentations but Mozilla will talk about what they do, and how they approach QA.
      
      They'll all have their laptops and will be more than happy to give ad-hoc demonstrations either projected or simply over-the-shoulder.
      
      Sponsorship: Mozilla

This could be a big opportunity for the London Agile Community (LAC) to help society and significantly improve the successful outcome of the Government projects. This evening will be an opportunity for the LACies to work out how we could work together to make the most of this opportunity. We will start with Rob Bowley and Roger Marlow sharing their experience of working with the government.\n\n    \xC2\x95 Rob Bowley will share his discussions with the government.\n    \xC2\x95 Roger Marlow will tell about Health2Works.\n\n\
      We will then have an hour of open space to discuss the following or any other questions we want to find an answer to:\n    1. How do we make this work? As a brand or a company or a guild?\n    2. How do we decide who is in?\n    3. How do we decide who is out?  \n\n\
      Afterwards we will find a convenient place to continue the conversation.  All Agile practitioners stationed in London or there about (like Matt in Glasgow) are welcome.\n\n\n\n"

      This is our monthly social gathering, which incorporates members of The London Java Community and Graduate Development Communities. This is an informal social evening most of the evening will be spent having ad-hoc informal discussions in small groups.
      
      We have booked out the top floor of the Porterhouse in Covent Garden [][1] [][2] [][3] [http://www.porterhous][4] ..., the venue is beautiful and they have beers from all over the world.
      
      The event will kick off at 6:30 PM and usually goes on until around 11:30 with members coming and going at all times throughout the evening. We usually attract 50 &ndash; 70 members so it is a lively event in which members, both junior and senior, can connect in a relaxed atmosphere and set the development world to rights.
      
      This is a chance to come along and meet, and chat, with other members of the London Technical Community. It is a great chance to meet other developers and has attracted members of all levels, I'll also be onsite so if anyone is looking for free recruitment advice it's a great chance to come along for a chat.

    - Manchester Javascript Unconference

    - |-
      Javascript has been receiving more attention on the past few years. Due to its dynamic OO features and its bad use by most, it is usually avoided or seen as pain for most devs.
      
      We think that we can change your mind and for such would like to invite you to come to the Manchester (un)conference. It should be an informal chat with some butties followed by some pub beer.

    - "About Dirigible:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Dirigible lets you build your numerical models in a spreadsheet grid on a web page, putting Python code in each cell \xE2\x80\x94 so a cell can hold not just numbers or text, but objects, lists, or even references to functions. If you want to change the way the spreadsheet is recalculated \xE2\x80\x94 by writing your own Python functions to call from your formulae, by importing new Python modules (like Numpy or SciPy), or even by running the formulae multiple times until you reach a goal \xE2\x80\x94 there's a code editor right there in the page to let you do that.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Once you're happy with your spreadsheet, perhaps you want to access it from other web pages? All Dirigible spreadsheets have an associated AJAX URL, which you can use to access their data from your own sites, or to call them with parameters to write a back-end for your site with minimal coding.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Dirigible sheets are recalculated on a grid of Python-based servers running on Amazon EC2. Imagine writing a model in one sheet to work out the price of a financial instrument, and then writing another sheet that uses 100 computers for a few seconds to price up a portfolio of hundreds of them.
